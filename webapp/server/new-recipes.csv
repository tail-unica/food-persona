22782,Jo Mama's World Famous Spaghetti,"My kids will give up a steak dinner for this spaghetti. It is a recipe I have been perfecting for years and it is so good (if I may humbly say) that my kids are disappointed when they eat spaghetti anywhere else but home! In fact they tell me I should open a restaurant and serve only this spaghetti and garlic bread. In response to requests, I have posted the recipe for Recipe #28559 that uses approximately 1/2 of the sauce from this
recipe. Have spaghetti one night and lasagna later!  Thanks to all of you who have tried my recipe and have written a review.  I read and appreciate every one of them!  Chef Note:  After I posted this recipe I remembered a funny incident--my dear husband usually has a nice bottle of wine handy so when I make a batch of spaghetti I just help myself to a splash of it. On one occasion, there wasn't a bottle opened, but there was a bottle sitting on the counter so I got out the corkscrew and helped myself. For some reason, the spaghetti that night was the best ever. My husband asked what wine I put in it and I showed him the bottle. He nearly fell off the chair. I had opened a rather expensive bottle he had bought to give his boss. Goes to show you--don't use a wine for cooking you wouldn't drink. You get the best results from a good wine!",https://www.food.com/recipe/jo-mamas-world-famous-spaghetti-22782,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/22/78/2/xy39o2sOTtudkgyDgZtv_spaghettisauce.jpg","Italian sausage, casings removed (mild or hot) | small onion, chopped (optional) | garlic cloves, minced | diced tomatoes | tomato paste | tomato sauce | water (for a long period of simmering for flavors to meld.

302120,Traditional Irish Shepherd's Pie,"Posting this per a request.  I've said it once and I'll say it again there is nothing Irish about Corned Beef and Cabbage, but Shepherd's Pie has always been and still is a staple of traditional Irish cooking.  This is a really easy, but tasty recipe that the whole family will enjoy.  It's nutritionally sound with all the major food groups represented.  The British use lamb in their Shepherd's Pie, but we've always used beef.  Do whatever you prefer or even try turkey if you're watching fat content.  This sauce is lovely and rich and should go well with any meat.  You can use fresh or leftover mashed potato.  I usually use 3 tbsp of ketchup instead of the 2tbsp of tomato paste as I like the hint of sweetness, but traditionally the paste would be more sound! You can also make individual pies which are always a hit with the kids.  This freezes beautifully too, so make two and save one!

The best will disappear first. | Do not freeze. | Pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one. | Feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it. | There will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center. | The thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky, you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound. | If there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket, you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves. | ------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------. | The heavier and more solid it is, the better it is. | Smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter. | You may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch. | Keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher. | --------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------. | Watch out for the red dyed ones. | Pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones. | The smaller the better. | If you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes, they are the best. | -------------Selecting the Carrots----------. | Get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots, because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage. | Serving a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day. | Preparing and cooking the meal-----------------------. | (It's going to take 3 hours with you there). | Use a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once. | Place the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot. | There's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate. | Add the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves. | Cover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer). | Bring to a boil. | Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 2 hours. | During the 2 hours------------------------. | Scrub and rinse the new red potatoes. | Remove any eyes and bad spots. | Leave as much of the peel as you can. | Quarter them (halve or whole if tiny). | Cover with water until ready for them. | Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green, rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together. Set aside. | Peel one carrot and cut it into quarters. Set aside. | Peel the onion and cut it into eighths. Set aside. | Rinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces. | I find that kitchen scissors do just fine. | After the 2 hours----------------------. | Add the potatoes on top of the brisket. | Add water to cover everything. | Bring to a boil. | Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes. | Add the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage. | Add water to cover everything. | Bring to a boil. | Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. | Check the cabbage to see if it is tender. | If not, simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it. | When done-----------------------. | In a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes, crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it. | Place the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley. | Gently stir until butter is melted, it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed. | Put the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes. | As I said, more is better. | Slice the brisket cross grain. | Hope there is leftovers for breakfast. | See my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine.

183399,Real English Fish and Chips With Yorkshire Beer Batter,"I was taught how to cook fish and chips by my mum when I was about 12 years old; we were living in Hong Kong at the time and it was my mum's way of treating us to a little bit of home as a treat! My mum had this recipe written down on the back of an old envelope stuck inside her Be-Ro cookbook from 1952 - I never use any other method now! One trick is to make sure that everything is prepared and assembled ready for frying takeoff!!! If you are cooking for two or more people, have your oven on with a lined tray to keep the fish and chips warm. If you really want to be totally authentic, cut up squares of greaseproof paper and sheets of newspaper - place the fish and chips onto the greaseproof paper and then into a sheet of newspaper. All you need now is a pickled onion, salt and MALT VINEGAR!
TIPS for CHIPS: I notice one reviewer had difficulty with the chips. Here are a few tips or tricks for chips: Make sure they are DRIED thoroughly. Make sure the fat is VERY hot - 190 degrees C. Certain potatoes are better for chipping, such as King Edwards, Desiree, Majestic, Maris Piper, and Romano. You can soak the chips for an hour before the first frying - it extracts excess starch, which helps in the ""crisping"" process! Always drain them thoroughly before serving. I hope these tips will help!",https://www.food.com/recipe/real-english-fish-and-chips-with-yorkshire-beer-batter-183399,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/18/33/99/K26LgZAxQ2ymEwATOxC0_FAC%25203%2520final%2520-%2520fish%2520and%2520chips.jpg","cod fish fillets or 4 $template2$ | plain flour | bicarbonate of soda | bottle british beer, Small | lemon, juice of | salt & pepper | extra flour | potatoes, peeled & chipped | fat or oil","Heat fat up in a chip pan or automatic deep fat fryer - mine has a chip setting which is 190°C. | Peel the potatoes and cut into chunky sized chips. Rinse and dry thoroughly. | Fry chips for about 3 minutes until soft but NOT coloured. Drain and shake well and set to one side. | Put some flour onto a plate.

86868,Corned Beef and Cabbage in Guinness,"The Irish butcher at my market gave me a new (to me anyway) recipe for corned beef & cabbage; he told me to cook it in Guinness Draught. (Guinness stout will make the dish bitter).  Since everyone raved about it, I thought I'd share the recipe he gave me.

216237,Traditional English Cheddar Cauliflower Cheese - Gratin,"When I was growing up, we NEVER called this dish a ""Gratin"" - it was always Cauliflower cheese and was invariably our main meal and NOT an accompaniment!

This dish has become very ""fashionable"" again is served in many guises, Cauliflower Noisette, Cauliflower Gratin, Cheese and Cauliflower Bake...but to me, it will always be just Cauliflower Cheese, and it remains one of my favourite meals! I do serve it as an accompaniment now, but you have to be very careful what you serve it with, as it is very cheesy and rich. Alternatively, just have it as a main meal and serve some homemade bread and butter with it and maybe some salad or steamed spring greens!

134945,German Cabbage Casserole - Kohl Und Hackfleisch,"Cabbage and meat mildly seasoned with garlic and onions in a creamy cheese sauce and topped with breadcrumbs for a pretty presentation! A real comfort food. Even those who say they HATE cabbage will eat this and like it! I have even made this without the meat- using bulgur and veggie broth. Here is how: Just replace the meat with the same amount of bulgur- (for 1 lb of meat sub 1 cup bulgur) you will want to soak the bulgur according to the instructions on the package- if you bought it in bulk here is how...

Bring 2 cups of veggie broth ( can use bouillon and water) per 1 cup bulgur

When broth is boiling stir in bulgur. Cover and simmer about 15 minutes or until bulgur is soft. All the broth should be absorbed. Fluff the bulgur with a fork as you would rice and add to your recipe.

I have used beef, pork, turkey and chicken  with great results too.

288885,"Dublin Coddle - Irish Sausage, Bacon, Onion and Potato Hotpot","This traditional supper dish of sausages, bacon, onions and potatoes dates back at least as far as the early eighteenth century. It seems to be more of a city dish than a rural one: it was a favourite of Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels and dean of Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin. In Dublin itself, coddle retains its reputation as a dish that can be prepared ahead of time and left in a very slow oven while the people who're going to eat it have to be out of the house for a while - making it an excellent dish for very busy people! The name of the dish is probably descended from the older word caudle, derived from a French word meaning ""to boil gently, parboil, or stew"". The more recent version of the verb, ""coddle,"" is still applied to gently cooked eggs, ""Coddled Eggs"". Please note, the sausages used should be the best quality 100% pork sausages you can get your hands on! This recipe would also work VERY well if cooked in a crock-pot, reduce the liquid by about half if cooking the coddle this way. Serve with Guinness and Irish soda bread. Although this is an easy to prepare one pot meal and its simplicity belies its amazing taste and flavour - comfort food at its best!

Read recipe in entirety first - it sounds more complex then it actually is.  You can decorate these to be quite elegant & fancy in presentation for Brunches, Bridal showers, or whatever suits your needs.  These sell at gourmet bakeries, coffee shops & cafe's for a pretty penny.  Note:  I do use mascarpone to make these as that is more traditional, but you could substitute with plain cream cheese if needed.
Also, I do use cupcake liners because I think they present better.
Lastly, it's best to prepare mascarpone filling & chill about 4-6 hours in advance or night before.
FYI:  You can fill the cupcakes by using a icing decorating (piping) bag filled with the mascarpone filling or use an old fashioned ketchup or mustard plastic bottle with nozzle point tip << yes, those ugly yellow & red things :-)

288125,Perfect Homemade Pasta or Spaghetti for Kitchenaid Mixers,"Per the internet site where the recipe was posted, this recipe is from Chef Andrea Apuzzo of Andrea's Restaurant in New Orleans.

My sweet hubby gave me a Kitchenaid Mixer for Christmas, and I recently bought the Pasta Roller & Cutter attachments for it.  I have tried many, MANY homemade pasta recipes and FINALLY found one that was PERFECT!  I made it last night for the first time and it made 1.5 pounds of pasta (commercially packaged pasta is normally 1 pound).  I cut it really thin for spaghetti, and I'm going to use it for everything now.  Can't wait to try making homemade ravioli, using this recipe.

Prep time includes ""rest"" period for dough & 10 minutes of drying time.  Cooking time includes 10 minutes to bring water to a boil.",https://www.food.com/recipe/perfect-homemade-pasta-or-spaghetti-for-kitchenaid-mixers-288125,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/28/81/25/01482025121.jpeg","semolina flour | all-purpose flour (I prefer bread flour for higher gluten) | large eggs, well beaten | extra virgin olive oil | salt | cold water","Combine the semolina flour, all purpose flour, and salt in a large bowl. Using a fork, mix these ingredients together, then using a sifter, sift into another bowl. Set aside. | In a separate bowl, combine the eggs & beat well with a fork. | Add extra-virgin olive oil to the eggs and mix with a fork. | Add the cold water to the egg & olive oil mixture, and mix with a fork. | Pour the liquid ingredients into your mixer bowl and attach the flat beater. | Add half of the sifted flour mixture, turn to speed 2 and mix 20 seconds. Add the rest of the sifted flour mixture and mix an additional 20 seconds. | Exchange flat beater for the dough hook. Turn to speed 2 and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, until a dough ball is formed. | Remove dough from bowl and hand-knead for 2 to 3 minutes. NOTE: Good pasta dough should be elastic and pliable, but FIRM (not soft like bread dough). It should not stick to your fingers or fall apart. To test for the correct consistency, pinch a small amount of dough together after kneading for 2 to 3 minutes -- if the dough stays together without sticking to your fingers or falling apart, it should work well. If too soft, add more flour by dusting the top of the dough and knead some more, continuing to dust the dough with flour until achieving the right consistency. If too dry, wet your hands and knead some more, continuing to wet your hands a little at a time & knead until the right consistency. (Achieving the right consistency isn't hard at all -- I got it just right the very first time I tried this recipe). | Wrap dough in plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour (this step is important). | Remove dough from refrigerator and let it rest for 15 minutes. Using your hands, roll dough into a log, about 12 inches long. | Cut log into 8 slices, then flatten each piece slightly. Spread slices out so they aren't touching and cover with plastic wrap. | Using the widest setting (1 on the Kitchenaid), turn mixer to speed 2 and taking one piece of the flattened dough, feed through rollers. Fold dough in half & roll again. Repeat 3 more times, lightly dusting the sheet of pasta in between each rolling if it feels the slightest bit sticky. | Move adjustment knob to setting 2 and feed the dough sheet through the rollers once. | Move adjustment knob to setting 3 and feed the dough sheet through the rollers once. | Continue to increase roller setting until desired dough thickness is reached: 3 for Thick ""kluski"" type egg noodles; 4 for standard egg noodles; 4 or 5 for lasagna noodles, fettuccine, spaghetti, and ravioli; 6 or 7 for tortellini, thin fettuccine, and linguine fini; 7 or 8 for VERY thin ""angel-hair"" type pasta/capellini or VERY fine linguine. | Separate sheets once desired thickness is achieved with a thin towel or piece of plastic wrap dusted with flour, so the dough doesn't dry out too much. | To cut the noodles, exchange the Pasta Roller Sheet attachment for the cutter attachment of choice, either the fettucine cutter for wider noodles or the spaghetti cutter for spaghetti or linguine. Run each sheet through the cutter. NOTE: Each sheet can be cut in half or thirds before putting through the cutter to prevent ""too long"" of strips. I prefer to use the longer sheets, rather than cutting them in half or thirds, as this reduces the time it takes to cut each sheet & hang to dry. | After cutting each sheet, hang to dry on a pasta rack. Dry for a minimum of 10 minutes. If you don't have a pasta rack, plastic hangers work great! IMPORTANT: Flour the pasta rack or the plastic hangers before placing pasta on them. ALSO, separate the strips of pasta as best you can, so they aren't touching. This way they won't dry sticking together. If you want to dry the pasta for later use, dry for several hours and then store in airtight plastic bags (i.e. Ziploc Freezer or Storage Bags). | When ready to cook, boil your water and add salt. For the 1.5 pounds of pasta, I use 2 teaspoons of salt. Oil in the water is not necessary. | Fresh pasta will cook faster than commercially bought pasta -- about 4 to 5 minutes in vigorously boiling water for el dente.",54,"4,55",53,time-to-make | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | healthy | pasta | easy | european | italian | dietary | low-saturated-fat | low-in-something | pasta-rice-and-grains | 4-hours-or-less

In Spain they tend to leave the shrimp unshelled. | I always try to make my chicken stock from scratch (time permitting), adding a bit of rosemary, a tiny pinch of saffron and a bit of thyme. If you're going to use bouillon, I'd recommend at least heating it up with these herbs and then straining before you start. | Keep your stock hot but not boiling as you cook. | Coat the bottom of your pallera/pan with olive oil. | Brown your chorizo over high heat for 1-2 minutes. Do not fully cook, just get the outside well browned. Set aside. This should add a nice red color and a hell of a flavor to your oil. | Brown the Rabbit for 2-3 minutes. It should not be fully cooked. Set aside. | Brown garlic, onion and bell pepper until they're softened, adding plum tomatoes shortly before the mixture is finished. | Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and on the other add the half can of tomato paste. Caramelize it, flipping it and spreading it until it begins to loosen (1-2 min over hight heat). | Mix all of the vegetables and meats together with the caramelized tomato paste also adding the paprika, parsley and thyme. | Add rice, mixing together and stirring as the rice browns (1-1 1/2) minutes. As the rice browns mix in the saffron. Make sure to break it between your fingers and stir it in to release all those tasty oils. | When the rice is slightly translucent add enough chicken stock to cover the whole mixture. If it's been kept warm, it will begin to boil almost immediately. Lower to a medium heat but keep it at a steady boil. | This is where paella is made and broken. I stir a few times in the first 5-10 minutes, adding broth as necessary to keep the rice fully covered. After this you must let the paella SIT! Let it cook another 10-20 minutes (I find that this step takes longer on a stovetop), adding broth bit by bit to keep the rice submerged until the rice on the top is al dente. Don't worry about rice burning to the bottom, this part (which actually has a name which escapes me at the moment, it's something like socarrat) is a tasty delicacy. | Once you've stirred the paella for the last time and are letting cook, when you have about 8 minutes left to cook lay shrimp on top, turning over after 2-4 minutes to cook other side. | When the rice on top is still quite al dente, take paella off of heat and cover. You must let it sit for 15-20 minutes. I've taken the lid off prematurely and ended up with a crunchy mess.

The recipe calls for the thicker, Greek Yogurt, also called, ""Greek Cheese"". If you can't find this type of yogurt, you can use plain, regular yogurt from the grocery store. But in order to get the sauce to the desired thicker consistency, you need to suspend the yogurt in a cheesecloth for a couple of hours to drain some of the water off.

If you don't mind it moderately runny, you can just make it as is and it is still delicious, just a little more messy.

113153,Iron Mike's Sweet Tomato Pizza Sauce - the Spirit of Cincinnati,"So I grew up in Cincinnati. 18 years of Cincy Chili, Ribs, Ice Cream, and, of course, LaRosa's Pizza, whose sauce is flavorful and SWEET. Now that I've been away, I find you can't get any pizza remotely close ANYwhere else. Now this is no copycat recipe, but it captures the spirit of Buddy L's pizza sauce. It complements vegetable toppings as well as meats... My wife and I have not ordered pizza out since this sauce was concocted... I HIGHLY recommend using caetb's pizza dough with this sauce. (Recipe #38512 - the one with the wine...) I put the ingredients in the bread machine and it turns out great every time. I cook the finished pizza between 400 and 425 degrees fahrenheit for 9-12 minutes on a normal cookie sheet, or 11-15 minutes on an ""air cookie sheet."" (My wife and I prefer the normal cookie sheet, so the crust cooks and the cheese doesn't burn...) I'd love to hear feedback from others, especially misplaced Cincinnati Folks - let me know your thoughts!

356428,Authentic French Onion Soup Courtesy of Julia Child,"There are a lot of French Onion Soup recipes on Zaar, but I think that this very authentic version deserves a place on the list. After making many of the existing recipes with success, I wrote down this recipe while watching Julia Child in a very old episode of ""The French Chef"". It takes a little longer, but the time is very well spent. It is also more detailed than others and includes fool-proof instructions for properly browning onions as well as many extra add-ins.
Don't be put off by the long list of ingredients. The sage, wine, raw onion, and cognac are optional, but they contribute a lot, so use what you have. The result is an out-of-this-world onion soup with an amazing depth of flavor. 
You can make this even days ahead of time and then add the toasted bread (""croutes"" as Julia calls them) and cheese and bake it the day of. This can be made vegetarian by using a beefy-flavored veg broth such as Better than Bullion Beefless broth instead of beef stock. Try it and love it!

A nice way to present this tea is to fill a zip-plastic baggie with some of the tea mix and place in a gift mug.

This will not taste like a brewed black tea.  The lemonade mix called for is one tiny packet, enough to make a 2 quart size pitcher (although you only use the mix dry).

Risotto is best with U.S. Arborio or medium grain rice. The starch in these grains absorbs flavors easily and takes on a creamy texture. | •Use a heavy pan with a thick bottom and sides to help distribute heat evenly. Make sure it's large enough to hold the cooked rice. The rice will expand to about three times its original volume. | •Don't rinse the rice. This removes the starch which gives risotto its wonderful creamy consistency. | •Sauté the rice in butter or oil. This coats each grain, allowing the rice to slowly absorb moisture and resulting in a creamier risotto. | •Use a simple, dry white wine. Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay always works well in risotto recipes. Risotto dishes also pair well with these wines. | •Keep the broth at a simmer when adding to the rice. Hot broth keeps the temperature at a more constant level, ensuring even and continuous cooking. | •Add broth one cup at a time, allowing the broth to fully absorb before adding more. The gradual addition of broth and slow cooking helps produce creamy risotto. | •Stir often. This keeps the grains in contact with the liquid for even cooking, prevents the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan, and helps to develop a creamy consistency. | •Get creative! Stir in additions such as asparagus, peas, cooked shellfish, ham or mushrooms at the end for a hearty, delicious risotto. | •Risotto is done when the rice is al dente -- creamy, yet firm in the center.

257812,Traditional English Cottage Pie With Cheese and Leek Topping,"Cottage pie, like its opposite lamb number, Shepherd's pie, was the ingenious idea of housewives many years ago, in order to create another warm and comforting meal usually from the Sunday Lunch left-overs! Cooked beef or lamb were diced or shredded and sometimes the vegetables were added to the meat mixture - such as peas or carrots. This recipe uses raw minced beef, but you could use minced cooked beef if you wish, I have added it as an alternative. The leeks were always added to the mashed potato topping when I was growing up - it was another way of utilising the leftovers! A bit like a Bubble and Squeak topping. I am not a lover of peas being added in my Cottage Pie, so I have suggested them as an option - I always prefer carrots as the vegetable to be added. Try to use mature Farmhouse Cheddar cheese for the topping - a little goes a long way, as it is so strong in flavour. The cheese is very luxurious, but takes this simple and comforting pie to a higher taste level, in my humble opinion!

179233,Authentic Chicken Parmesan,"This is my homemade recipe that I have been working on for over 10 years.  Many people have devoured this meal, and enjoyed its rich and authentic Italian taste.

More milk, approximately 1/4 cup, can be added to make the milk-egg mixture less thick. | Dip a chicken breast into the milk-egg mixture. Remove the chicken breast once it is well coated and allow the excess to drip off into the bowl for a second or two. Place the chicken breast into the breading mixture. Roll chicken around to thoroughly coat all sides of chicken. | Once oil has reached optimum temperature, place the minced garlic into the oil and stir around for a second. Turn temperature of burner down between medium and medium-high. The garlic should be sizzling. Do not allow to burn. After a minute of constantly stirring the minced garlic, place the breaded chicken breast from the bowl into the frying pan. Allow room for the remaining breasts to be placed into the frying pan. | Repeat step 6 above for each of the remaining breasts (one at a time). Place each breaded breast into the frying pan. | Cook the chicken breasts on each side to a nice golden brown. This may take about 5 minutes per side. It really depends on the temperature you have your burner set at. You do not want to burn the chicken breasts. | Once each breast has reached a nice golden brown color, remove from frying pan and place on a plate lined with a few paper towels. | Preheat oven to 375 degrees. | Take a square glass pan, or equivalent, and spray with cooking spray (i.e., spray Pam). | Pour half of the jar of spaghetti sauce into the square pan. (Note: if you are using a pan that is larger than a square glass pan, you may need to use more than one jar of spaghetti sauce. I used a 13x13 square glass pan.). | Pour 2 tablespoons minced garlic into the glass pan with the spaghetti sauce. Mix around to spread garlic throughout the pan. | Place each chicken breast into the pan without having the sides touching. Do not overlap the chicken breasts. | Pour the remaining spaghetti sauce onto each chicken breast. Spread sauce over each chicken breast to ensure the sides and top of each breast is covered with sauce. | Cover pan with aluminum foil. There is no need to have a tight seal around the edges of the pan. The foil can be loosely placed on the pan with some gaps for venting to occur. | Place pan into oven on the middle rack. Bake for 40 minutes. | After 40 minutes have passed, take pan out of the oven. Carefully uncover the aluminum foil to avoid burns from escaping steam. | Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the sauce and chicken breasts. The idea is to have each breast thoroughly covered with cheese. It is okay if cheese gets on the sauce. It will make the dish look even better. | Place uncovered into the oven. Bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and light brown. | Remove pan from oven. Place on a wire rack or on top of the stove burner, and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. | Sprinkle parsley on the top of each chicken breast. (This is for garnishment.) | Serve over top of cooked pasta. Spaghetti noodles are the best for this meal. Spoon sauce over top of each dish. (Fresh homemade spaghetti noodles are the absolute best for this meal.) | Note: As mentioned above in the preparation steps, you may wish to use more sauce when baking the chicken. The chicken will absorb a lot of the fluids in the sauce. I use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce and 4 tablespoons minced garlic in the baking pan. We love sauce in our family. | An Alternate method: | You can make this dish exactly as described above, and add one modification that will make this dish even more tasty. Stuff each of the chicken breasts, before breading, with a ricotta cheese mixture. | The ricotta cheese mixture should contain ricotta cheese (8 - 16 oz), 2 tablespoons garlic, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon basil and oregano. | When stuffing the chicken breasts, make sure you flatten out each breast with a pounder (to approximately 1/4"" thick). Flatten each breast on a piece of wax paper to avoid sticking to surface. | Spread a nice portion of cheese mixture onto each breast. | Fold breasts in half and seal with wooden tooth picks. You may need to use a lot of tooth picks to thoroughly seal each breast. | Once each breast has been stuffed and sealed, refer to step 6 above for breading each breast.",30,"4,7",31,time-to-make | course | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | occasion | main-dish | pasta | poultry | oven | european | kid-friendly | romantic | italian | chicken | stove-top | dietary | inexpensive | meat | chicken-breasts | pasta-rice-and-grains | spaghetti | taste-mood | savory | equipment | presentation | served-hot | 4-hours-or-less

I have successfully half-doubled this recipe when only larger corned beef cuts were available- larger cuts will take longer to boil but the roughly the same time to bake because the baking stage is merely to cook the dry rub into a glaze. | PLEASE NOTE: If you substitute regular brown ale, then you will not get the same result in both color and flavor (You may substitute another Irish ale or even an Irish lager if you must, but we really prefer the red ale).",30,"4,62",30,weeknight | time-to-make | course | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | occasion | main-dish | beef | european | holiday-event | irish | dietary | st-patricks-day | meat

203349,My Mum's Easy and Traditional English Yorkshire Pudding,"Exactly as the title says, this is my Mum's Traditional English Yorkshire Pudding recipe and it is so easy. It is slightly different from my Toad-in-the-Hole batter recipe, the Yorkshire puddings in this recipe are lighter. (You need a more substantial batter for the addition of sausages!!)
I have held off posting this for a while as it is so easy, but it works -please see my photo's! The great thing about this recipe is that it works on equal measures of volume and so there is no weighing or measuring as such. So, if there are only two of you, use a very small cup - if there are a crowd of you, use a big cup, jug or a mug!! Easy! 
One tip - ALWAYS make sure the oil/fat is SIZZLING hot before you pour in your batter; preheat your tins with the oil/fat before pouring in your batter......that's about it really!
NOTE:
(I have made the yield between 8-16 individual Yorkshire puddings, depending on the size cup you use. A tip - 4 beaten eggs will make about 8 to 10 Yorkshires.)

N.B.

My first reviewer quite rightly stated that Yorkshires are often cooked in a large dish/tin; traditionally UNDERNEATH the meat drippings actually!! But, my grandmother & my Mum also made very Traditional Yorkshires in special tins - as photographed; as I understand it, popovers are baked in smaller diameter tins - Yorkshire Pudding Tins have a diameter of at least 4"" wide & generally only have 4 holes in a tray!!",https://www.food.com/recipe/my-mums-easy-and-traditional-english-yorkshire-pudding-203349,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/20/33/49/picaG1FHr.jpg",beaten egg | plain flour | milk | water | salt | pepper | cooking oil or 1 -2 tablespoon dripping,"Preheat your oven to 240C,475F or gas mark 9.

(I've since learned how to spell Nokedli.). | Start by heating the oil in a large pot and browning your chicken parts. | Remove the chicken and add the butter or margarine to the pot. | Sauté the onion in the melted butter until transparent. | Add paprika, chicken, and water, bring to a boil then reduce to simmer for 45 minutes. (NOTE: I've learned over the years that using a 32 oz box of broth adds a lot of flavor to the dish.). | Chicken should be very tender and about to fall off bones. | Remove chicken to bowl. | Add enough fresh water to pot to bring back to original level. | Check flavor of broth. | If flavor is weak add enough bullion to produce a well flavored broth. (SKIP this step if you used broth.). | Bring broth to boil. | Combine flour, salt, and pepper with eggs (the more eggs the richer the batter but two is OK) to form a thick batter. | Now comes the tricky (and boring) part. | Drop batter in boiling broth in 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon amounts until all batter is in pot and cooked. | Spaetzle is cooked when it floats on surface. | You may need to remove some to get it all in the pot. | With all spaetzle cooked and in pot you now add your sour cream to broth. The amount is individual according to how creamy you wish the sauce to become (and how much water you started with). | At this point I usually add about three tablespoons of flour mixed with one cup of water to thicken the broth. Sorry I omitted this step in the original submission. | The sauce and spaetzle is the best part of this dish so be sure to make enough! They will be coming back for seconds on that part of the dish. | One of the most surprising things about this dish is it actually tastes better the second day.

65363,Italian Rum Cake,"Italian Rum Cake is a delicious 3 or 4 layer cake, which is a tradition for birthdays/special occasions in many Italian families. There are 3 basic parts to the cake; sponge cake layers, pasticciera cream (filling) and (stabilized) whipped cream. Below are the recipes for all three parts. If you make it with 3 layers, omit the whipped cream layer. The sponge cake and pasticciera creams may be made a day ahead. The whipped cream should be whipped just before assembling the cake. Prep/Cook times do not include the 3-4 hour chilling time for the pasticciera cream.

PLEASE NOTE: This is an egg leavened cake! The egg yolks and whites MUST be beaten to the correct volume and consistency or the recipe will not work. Also, the other ingredients must be folded in (beaten WHITES folded INTO the YOLK/sugar mixture NOT the other way around) in the order given in the directions or the cake will not turn out. The finished layers will be thin depending on the size of your pan. The smaller the pan, the thicker the layers and the longer the baking time needed.

A traditional recipe handed down to me by my Mum and her Mum before her......it was my favourite after school tea time meal & is still a firm family favourite even now! I serve mine with lashings of onion gravy and piles of fluffy & buttery mashed potatoes. I used to make mini versions of this recipe for my daughter when she was little - they make great appetizers before a Halloween/Bonfire night supper or a children's Party! For the mini version, just use a small cake/pie tins or a small muffin tray and split your sausages into quarters OR use cocktail sausages. The following recipe is for 4 people served with potatoes & gravy - the recipe can easily be doubled for more people or if served by itself.",https://www.food.com/recipe/traditional-british-toad-in-the-hole-and-mini-toads-too-184023,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/18/40/23/riaTm7cQRNm0O2mVHQQV_20201214_193450.jpg",sausage or 8 $template2$ | plain flour | eggs | milk | salt | pepper | drippings or 1 tablespoon vegetable oil,"Preheat oven to 220°C or 450°F. | Pour the dripping or vegetable oil into a large metal roasting tin.

219423,Lamb for Learners! Redcurrant and Honey Glazed Lamb (Crock Pot),"This is the name that my daughter came up with, for my most requested lamb dish! She did not realise how easy it was to cook, as the results are so sophisticated and special! I have never made it other than in the crock-pot, but I am sure it would cook very well in an AGA or wood burning range......long and slow. This is an ALL YEAR around recipe, as we have cooked this in the summer and served this meltingly tender lamb with salads and crusty bread - as well as in the winter with mountains of mashed potatoes! The redcurrant and honey glaze is sensational, and makes the most divine gravy or sauce. Do not be tempted to use a cheap and low fruit content redcurrant jelly, it gives nowhere near the same taste and results as a high fruit jelly. I always use a leg of lamb for this dish - but I suspect that shoulder of lamb would work extremely well.

200864,Cheat's French Cassoulet - Crock Pot or Le Creuset,"This great Cheat's recipe has all the elements of a traditional French Cassoulet - assorted meats, beans, carrots, tomatoes, wine & tomatoes - but is very easy & does not include Confit d'Canard if you find that difficult to obtain. However, you need to get hold of high meat content sausages to give it a more authentic taste. I have given a few variations at the bottom of the recipe; this recipe works extremely well in a Crock pot as well as the more traditional Le Creuset casserole dishes. French comfort food at it's best! Serve with mashed potatoes & crisp Savoy Cabbage.
This recipe can be easily doubled for bigger or hungry crowds of diners!

NOTE on BEANS:
I use tinned/canned beans or pre-soaked and cooked beans in this recipe; for uncooked beans, you will need to soak them overnight and then boil them; then increase the cooking time by about 15 minutes. This was posted as a ""Cheat's"" recipe, meaning cutting a few corners if you don't have time - i.e. use tinned beans!!

138647,Beer-Battered Fish With Tartar Sauce,"One of the things that sticks out most in my mind about my last trip to Ireland is how incredibly good the fish and chips are. They were served in a newspaper cone that was stuffed with waffle fries and fish. This recipe brings back those fond memories. the secret for a crackling crisp coating is to fry fish in small batches. Too many pieces will cool the oil, and the fish will be soggy and greasy. Serve with your favorite chips. The Cod Clan:
Atlantic pollack, haddock, and hake are among the members of the extensive cod family. Although these fish vary slightly in terms of texture and flavor, one can generally be substituted for another.

I am an Italian-American who enjoys great food! Not only are these mashed potatoes delicious, but are easy enough to make that even my dad can make them! And he can barely cook soup, trust me! These rolled mashed potatoes are inspired by a few different cultures. They are similar to a perogy (Ukrainian), only wrapped in a thin spring roll paper (Oriental) instead of typical perogy dough, and combined with many of the typical toppings you'd find in many Southern U.S. dishes.

Once heated and ready to eat, you must add the other filling ingredients to the mashed potatoes. The cream and butter add just that extra traditional flavor and keep the potatoes very moist. Mix all the filling ingredients together. | Spring Rolls: | I like use fresh spring roll wrappers about 4 inches wide x 6 inches long, however it is up to you how big or small you want your rolls to be. Add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the mashed potato mix to each spring roll. Roll the spring roll. Secure the ends by adding a bit of water to one end and firmly pressing down onto the other end. Repeat until you have either no more mashed potato mix, or no more spring roll wrappers.,Cook:,I prefer to use a deep pan. Add enough olive oil to fill 4 inches of the bottom of the pan. Heat olive oil until it starts to bubble. Add a few spring rolls at a time to the oil, cook for about 1 minute on each side. The trick is, you want the wrapper to stay somewhat soft and easy to bite into. Frying for more than a minute or two will make the wraps too crunchy. Drain the rolls by placing them onto paper towels. | Assemble Fully Loaded Rolled Mashed Potatoes: | Place the potato rolls on a serving plate. Here is where you can get fancy.

204257,Polenta Lasagna With Feta and Kale,"This is one of my favorite recipes, full of Mediterranean flavor and high in calcium. It uses pecorino romano, a salty parmesan-like hard cheese made of sheep's milk. I used a goat's milk feta but you can use any type of feta you can find.

This recipe calls for a tube of pre-made, ready-to-slice polenta which you can find online or at most health food or gourmet food stores and some mainstream groceries. I use the traditional polenta (unflavored) from Food Merchants.

327458,Traditional Buttery French Croissants for Lazy Bistro Breakfasts,"I do not profess to make these all the time; living in France gives me access to wonderful croissants and other French breakfast pastries, However, these are even BETTER than MOST I can buy at the boulangerie, really! It is a time consuming process to make them, but the results are well worth the effort. The butter-enriched dough can be made the night before and stored in the fridge, and it can also be frozen. Once you have the hang of adding the butter to the dough and turning and rolling it to trap the air in between the layers, you are nearly there with the technique. This is my own recipe for croissants, and the quantity yields between 8 and 12 croissants, depending on how accurate you are with the measurements of the triangles before they are rolled. I usually start my dough off in my bread machine for the mixing, kneading and proving - it just gives me more time in the kitchen to get on with other things. I have also given the traditional method by hand, and the dough can also be mixed with a dough hook in a food mixer - choose whatever method is best for you! These croissants can also be frozen - before being baked; defrost overnight in the fridge before baking as normal.

Using a wooden spoon, slowly mix in the warm milk and the warm water until the mixture forms into a pliable dough. Cover and put the dough in a warm place, until it has nearly doubled in size. | BUTTER DOUGH: Place the dough (both from the bread machine and by hand) on a floured surface and knead well until it feels elastic.Return the dough to the bowl, cover and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Return the chilled dough to your floured work surface and roll it into a rectangular shape, around 50cm X 20cm - 20"" X 8"". | Separate the remaining butter into 3 portions and then using one third of the butter, dot the butter over the upper two thirds of the rolled dough, keeping a 1cm/1/2"" border around the edges. Fold the dough into three , bringing up the bottom unbuttered part of the dough, and then folding the top buttered part of the dough over. | Give the dough a half turn so that the open edges are now top and bottom and seal the edges with your rolling pin. Then take your rolling pin and press the dough at intervals to seal the dough and create air pockets. Roll out into a rectangle again, the same size, and then continue as before, two more times until your butter is used up - please see photos as a guide. It is important to return the rolled dough to the fridge in between each rolling to ensure the butter does not melt and the dough does not become too sticky. After the last rolling when all the butter is used, return the dough to the refrigerator to chill for a further 30 minutes. | Remove from fridge and roll carefully into a big rectangle 50cm/30cm/24inx12in cut in half lengthways, divide each half into 4 to 6 triangles. Take one triangle at a time,and brush the triangle with the egg wash of milk and egg. Then from the widest edge of the triangle, roll up loosely and place in a crescent shape on a tray. Brush with the egg wash over the top for the glaze. | TO FREEZE: At this point the croissants can be frozen; Open freeze them on a large tray, a baking tray is fine and then pack them into a rigid container or freezer bags when they are frozen. For use, remove from freezer the number required for breakfast, put onto baking tray and leave overnight. Put into a hot oven and cook for about 20 minutes until browned and risen. | TO BAKE: Place the shaped croissants on baking trays lined with silicone baking parchment and leave to rise for 30 minutes to 1 hour.Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown and puffy.",22,"4,7",22,time-to-make | course | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | occasion | breads | breakfast | eggs-dairy | asian | french | hungarian | middle-eastern | 1-day-or-more | european | finger-food | heirloom-historical | holiday-event | vegetarian | eggs | turkish | dietary | christmas | oamc-freezer-make-ahead | valentines-day | yeast | brunch | number-of-servings | presentation | served-cold | served-hot

I was watching a recent episode (""Pizza Party"") of his show and went to the web as soon as it was over to get the recipe. Here it is, but the instructions are different than what you'll find on the web as I use my heavy-duty mixer rather than make this by hand. Enjoy!",https://www.food.com/recipe/emeril-lagasses-perfect-pizza-dough-84545,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/84/54/5/picHqLy4E.jpg","warm water (110F) | envelope active dry yeast | sugar | all-purpose flour, divided | extra virgin olive oil | salt","In the bowl of your heavy-duty mixer (like a Kenwood or KitchenAid), stir together the water, yeast and sugar; let sit until the mixture is foamy, which takes about 5 minutes. | Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the oil and salt into the yeast mixture and, using the paddle attachment (also known as the K beater), combine until mixture is smooth. | Switch to the dough hook. | With the machine running at low, add remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time; make sure each addition of flour is incorporated before adding the next. | Once all the flour has been added, turn up the speed and let the machine knead the dough for about 3 minutes; it should be very smooth and perhaps a bit tacky. | Feel free to add an extra minute or two of kneading if you wish; it won't hurt the dough at all. | Rub the insides of a large mixing bowl with a little olive oil; remove dough from machine, form into a ball, and place into oiled bowl, turning dough over to make sure all sides are oiled. | Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free area to rise; the dough should nearly double in size, which will take about 60 to 90 minutes. | An old habit of mine is to place a towel around the bowl, just to make sure no drafts get to the dough. | When dough is ready, lightly punch it down and knead it a bit, still right in the bowl. | Lightly flour your work surface and place dough ball on it; let it rest for 10 minutes. | This makes one large pizza; if you prefer two smaller pizzas, cut dough in half, then form into two balls and let rest, as above. | After dough has rested, form into a 16-inch round (or two 8-inch rounds) and you're ready to make pizza, using your favourite toppings. | The biggest trick here, when stretching out the dough, is not to get frustrated; if you find you're stretching the pizza and it's resisting and is too elastic, bouncing right back from each stretch, just walk away for a few minutes; after you let the pizza rest again, you'll find the dough will let you stretch it out. | You might even want to try flipping it into the air a bit! | Warning: let it come down on your knuckles, not your fingertips, or you'll tear the dough! | The best way to bake your prepared pizza is on a baking stone (or you can use a pizza pan, if you don't have a stone) on your lowest oven rack; Emeril suggests 8 to 10 minutes at 475F, but a little lower temperature for a little longer works just fine too.",22,"4,7",21,celebrity | time-to-make | course | cuisine | preparation | occasion | healthy | flat-shapes | breads | main-dish | oven | easy | european | holiday-event | kid-friendly | kosher | low-fat | vegan | vegetarian | pizza | italian | dietary | new-years | low-cholesterol | low-saturated-fat | inexpensive | healthy-2 | low-in-something | superbowl | novelty | equipment | small-appliance | mixer | 4-hours-or-less

297235,Golabki - Polish Cabbage Rolls,"Polish cabbage rolls (filled with a mixture of rice, pork, and beef) stewed in tomatoes.

This is a dish I remember my Gram making.  I've taken the recipe and tweaked it as I've cooked.

The dish is hearty and delicious--and known by other names throughout Eastern Europe.  I've made it for friends who have never had Polish food before, and they loved it with a fervor that surprised me.

It may look very time intensive, but it's a meal unto itself and can be frozen or reheated easily.  It also helps to split it into two main phases:  1) making the meat filling and freezing the cabbage the night before; 2) assembling the golabki.

70620,Ev's Lentil Soup (Greek - Fakess),"In honour of Mirjam. This soup is called Fakess (pronounced 'fahKESS') in Greek. It is very good. This belongs to that category of Greek cooking called 'Ladera' which, literally translated, means 'made of oil'.  Olive oil is not just a fat, it is a key ingredient and flavour booster and is totally necessary. When my oldest son was turning 4 and I asked him what he wanted for his birthday dinner, this is what he ordered. I've given directions for both conventional cooking and crockpot - which I tried today.  The pearl barley is not traditional, but we really like it.

Add 1/2 lb of minced bacon, but cut back the olive oil to a couple of tablespoonfuls; or add 1 lb of sliced sausage, like Kielbasa. Again, cut back on the oil. | New note: (added Dec. 27, 2004) I have taken to adding 1/2 cup bulgur wheat to this soup when I add all the other ingredients; it makes the soup more nutritionally complete if totally vegetarian, and really good and hearty; I strongly urge you try this version. | Freezer Note: This makes quite a lot of soup - definitely enough for 2 meals (plus a little extra for the super-hungry) for my family of 5.

326393,Ahoy There!  Moules Marinières - French Sailor's Mussels,"I adore moules, mussels, and this is the classic French recipe for them. Moules Marinières is also commonly known as Sailor's mussels or Mariner's mussels. The dish consists of delicately steamed fresh mussels in a white wine, garlic, parsley, butter, onion and cream sauce.
Moules Marinières can be served as an appetising starter or even a light main meal. It is delicious served with fresh crusty bread or with frites (chips/fries). There is nothing more mouth-watering than a huge bowl of artistically presented mussels, yet the fun part is eating them. The best way is to use an empty mussel shell as the ""spoon"" in which to pick the remaining mussels from their shells and then eat them. It's a brilliant excuse to use your fingers to eat rather than the usual knife and for - very tactile!  A traditional French recipe will use butter, however the butter may be substituted for a few tablespoons of olive oil for a healthier option - I sometimes use a mix of butter and olive oil I hope you find the step-by-step photos helpful, this recipe was used in the September 2008 Cooking School for the TOTM - hopefully, the photos will debunk the myth that mussels are hard to prepare and cook, NOT so!

Pull off the lower petals that are small and tough. Cut off the top inch of the artichoke and rub with half a lemon to preserve the green color. Or you may put the artichokes in water that has some lemon juice in it. If you wish, trim the thorny tips of the petals with kitchen shears. | Place the artichokes in the steaming broth, bottom up.

Dip the ends of the leaves in lemon juice and melted butter if desired. When you reach the center cone of purple prickly leaves, remove it. This is the choke that protects the heart. Now, scrape away the thistle fuzz covering the artichoke heart. The heart is the meatiest and in my opinion, the best part of the artichoke. Steamed artichokes may be served hot or cold.

254738,My Chicken Parmigiana With Homemade Pasta Sauce,"This is my version of chicken parmigiana. The sweet sauce is what sends this recipe over the top although the chicken parmigiana is excellent as well! I developed this sauce after tasting various versions of my Italian friends' sauces and getting their recipes. My family likes a sweet sauce so if you don't like it sweet, just omit the sugar. I do recommend that you add a little sugar, though, to remove some of the acidity taste from the sauce. Quite frankly, if you don't like a sweet sauce, though, you might be better off trying another recipe because that is why I developed this version. I usually let the sauce simmer for most of the day until I am ready to make the chicken parmigiana. However, the sauce can be ready as fast as an hour if you need it to be. But the longer the sauce simmers, the more delicious and thick it will be! This recipe does make more sauce than is needed for the chicken parmigiana and the side of spaghetti or angel hair, but I just freeze the remaining sauce and use it for another time. This is also the basic recipe I use to serve over any type of pasta.

385433,Mini Shepherd's Pie-So Good!,"A great recipe from Aaron McCargo on Big Daddys' House. On Food Network, this recipe has 52 outstanding reviews! You can sub turkey or even veggie crumbles for the ground beef! Kids can help make this dish and have fun doing it! This can also be made in a 9x13"" pan. This is good frozen and microwaved. Great to take in your lunch bag, to a picnic, or to a tailgate party! Enjoy! A little history:
The key to dating Shepherd's pie is the introduction (and acceptance) of potatoes in England. Potatoes are a new world food. They were first introduced to Europe in 1520 by the Spanish. Potatoes did not appeal to the British palate until the 18th Century. (Foods America Gave the World, A. Hyatt Verrill, page 28). Shepherd's Pie, a dish of minced meat (usually lamb, when made with beef it is called ""Cottage Pie"") topped with mashed potatoes was probably invented sometime in the 18th Century by frugal peasant housewives looking for creative ways to serve leftover meat to their families. It is generally agreed that it originated in the north of England and Scotland where there are large numbers of sheep--hence the name. The actual phrase ""Shepherd's Pie"" dates back to the 1870s, when mincing machines made the shredding of meat easy and popular.""",https://www.food.com/recipe/mini-shepherds-pie-so-good-385433,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/38/54/33/T98f4bcjQ3KqPjBpRzsL_DSC_0612.JPG","spray | refrigerated biscuits (The flakey are good or Grands) | olive oil | ground beef (chuck or ground turkey or chicken or veggie crumbles) | onion, minced | salt | cracked black pepper | minced garlic | all-purpose flour | beef stock (or chicken or turkey or vegetable) | frozen mixed vegetables | chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley | chopped fresh rosemary leaf | leftover mashed potatoes (or use instant or storebought in a pinch) | granulated garlic powder | granulated onion powder | shredded cheddar cheese","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. | Spray a 12-count muffin pan with cooking spray.

This first yeast-mixture should be still fluid. Cover and let rise in warm place for 20 minutes. | Add remaining sugar, melted butter, egg and a good pinch of salt and mix with yeast mixture and flour. Knead with floured hands until dough is peeling away from the side of the bowl and blistering. This step may take 10 minutes (or more). Use some additional flour, if dough is too sticky. At the end you should have a smooth dough. | Cover and let rise in warm place for about 25 to 30 minutes or until dough has doubled. | Meanwhile prepare the plums. Cut lengthwise and pit them. Cut the still connected plum halves once again lengthwise, but do not cut through. You should have a depitted plum which you can easily flatten. | Grease backing tray.

But you can replace it by 1 1/2 packages dry yeast. | NOTE on Damson Plums: a traditional German Plum Cake is made with the slightly tart and not too juicy Damson Plums. You can also use other plum varieties, but the plums shouldn't be over-ripped or too juicy.

These are my favourite meat skewers and make a regular appearance on the ""Al Fresco Lunch Table"" during the Summer months.

128732,Dutch Apple Pie (Oma's Appeltaart),"This recipe is for the traditional dutch apple pie, found on a Belgian website. It can be served both warm or cold, usually with whipped cream (but ice cream tastes great as well :D ).

You will need a *springform* cake pan, or a lot of patience, or you will not be able to get the pie out!

Because Dutch recipes generally use grams instead of cups for dry ingredients, I have included the measurements in grams as well.

The dough is shortbread-like and may take a lot of time to get right. It took me ages to get it to form a ball, but it worked out fine in the end. If you're getting tired of it, add a little milk, but don't despair for with or without the milk, it *will* from a ball in the end.

If you want, you can prepare the apple mixture the previous day and keep it in the fridge, the flavors will blend wonderfully. If you want to prepare the dough in advance, take it out of the fridge in time, because it's really hard to work with when it's just been in the fridge for a whole night.

The preparation time is a rough estimate and assumes that you peel the apples while the dough is in the fridge. I'm quite slow at preparing so it could be anywhere between 1 and 2 hours for you.

Last but not least, *do* make sure you have a bit of dough left over for the third to last step - you deserve a little something for all that hard work! :D",https://www.food.com/recipe/dutch-apple-pie-omas-appeltaart-128732,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/12/87/32/t9NMYUx5S4KA0Zn6ery6_290708069382963.jpg","egg | semolina to absorb the juices | self-rising flour (300g) | butter (180g) or 3/4 cup $template2$ (180g) | brown sugar (150g) | vanilla essence or (8 g) packet vanilla sugar | pinch salt | apples (1kg) | raisins (washed and dried, 100g) | granulated sugar (40g) | cinnamon (or more to taste) | lemon juice (or more to taste)","For the dough: | Sieve the flour, brown sugar, vanilla and the salt into a bowl. | Cut the butter or margarine into small cubes and add these to the flour mixture. | Beat the egg and add 3/4 of it to the flour mixture (you will need the rest for the top). | Using two knives, mix the butter/margarine and the flour mixture. | Using one hand, kneed it to form the dough - you should be able to form it into a ball (this may take quite long). | Put the ball of dough in the fridge for about an hour, in the meantime, make the filling. | For the filling: | Peel the apples and cut them in cubes (allow the sizes to vary--itll taste better). | In a (large) bowl, combine apple, raisins, (granulated) sugar, cinnamon, the lemon juice and half of the semolina. | Mix well and allow the flavors to blend, stirring occasionally.,Then:,Butter a 9-inch round springform cake pan, or spray it with a non-stick spray. | Line the pan (bottom and sides) with about 3/4 of the dough - as long as the pan is covered, the layer need not be very thick. | Cover the bottom with the remaining semolina. | Add the filling, but try to leave the juices out. | On a lightly floured surface, roll out the remaining dough until its less than 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) thick. | Cut the dough into strips and layer them over the apple pie to form a raster, covering no more than one third of the surface--you should be able to see quite a bit of the apple pieces (see picture). | If necessary, use (some of) the remaining dough to make the edges a bit higher. | Use the remaining egg to coat the dough strips. | Bake the pie at 175°C / 340°F, just below the middle of your oven, for about 75 minutes. | If you have any dough left, roll it out, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon (or left-over apple mixture) and bake it on baking paper for a few minutes. | Remove the springform only *after* the pie has cooled. | Serve warm (reheat in oven or microwave) or cold, with whipped or ice cream, or freeze.",17,"4,79",16,lactose | time-to-make | course | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | occasion | low-protein | pies-and-tarts | desserts | fruit | oven | european | kid-friendly | vegetarian | pies | belgian | dutch | dietary | free-of-something | low-in-something | apples | taste-mood | sweet | equipment | presentation | served-cold | served-hot | 4-hours-or-less

Halloumi is a traditional Cypriot cheese, which is still made locally by lots of Cypriot ladies - you often see the cheeses ""hanging out to dry"" in old, but hopefully clean (?) tights or stockings! Halloumi is an extremely good cheese for cooking, it maintains its shape and becomes toasty and slightly salty when fried or grilled. You can buy packs of good quality Cypriot Halloumi cheese in most supermarkets or in a delicatessen. It can last for up to ONE year when bought in a vacuum-sealed pack! Halloumi is the Greek Cypriot name for this cheese, the Turkish Cypriots call it Hellim - it is the same cheese however, and the best cheese is made with 100% sheep’s milk.

133816,Turkey Shepherd's Pie With Two-Potato Topping (Or Chicken),"This is the ultimate Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner leftover recipe. The recipe keeps in mind that the ingredients being used are from separate dishes that are *already* seasoned. If you are making either of the potatoes from scratch for the recipe, go ahead and season them as if you were making that dish to serve as a side. The same with the gravy, if it is not homemade roasted turkey gravy, add some more seasoning to it. Of course you do not have to have leftovers to make this, but it is a good way to use up the turkey, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and gravy without the dish tasting like leftovers. I have also made it with chicken with excellent results. This is a real family pleaser and our 4 year old actually asks for this for dinner a lot. The original recipe was adapted from Chef Jimmy Bradley of the Red Cat in New York City.  It can also be prepared in individual 1 1/2-cup ramekins; check them for doneness after 20 minutes. WINE: A bighearted Chardonnay will echo the texture of the smooth gravy and the soft mashed potato topping.

293899,"Pizza Gain Aka Pizzagaina, Pizza Rustica, Italian Easter Ham Pie","This is my Grandmother's recipe for Pizza Gain (AKA PizzaGaina, Pizza Gaina, Pizza Rustica, Italian Easter Ham Pie, Italian Ham Pie, Easter Pizza, Pizza Chiena, etc.).  There are many varieties out there depending on the region of Italy you are from.  My family makes it in their traditional style from their village in Naples (Napoli) Italy.  There are some areas that use sausage or hard boiled eggs, this one does not.  This is also the recipe for a very large pie.  I make it in my roasting pan without the rack in it.  It is meant to be divied up & shared.  I give a hunk to about 6 different people.
The story, as its been told to me, is that during Lent & the 40 days of fasting... this Pizza Gaina was made by the Italian women on Good Friday as an abundance of meat & richness that was abstained during Lent.  It was prepared, cooked, and chilled on Good Friday, but could not be cut & eaten before noon on Easter Saturday.  Although some people serve it on Easter Sunday.  Many Easter dishes were made in advance so the local Priest could come and Bless the prepared foods for the Feast of Easter. My family would all gather at my Grandparents house on Saturday & enjoy it together with our Aunts, Uncles, & cousins.  It's a tradition that I'm glad to continue to keep those memories going.  You can make your own pizza dough for this or purchase it.  I sometime buy it at our local pizzeria.  This is served chilled.  When heated, becomes runny.  Also, I cut up all the meats & mozzarella the night before so it's ready to go Friday.
I also put a heat-proof oven liner on my bottom rack in case anything oozes out.  * Want to specify almost everything is cubed or cut to little slices cubed...  Also, please read the ingredients thoroughly, like the capicola is the HOT capicola, proscuittini isn't listed so I made the notation... etc.

325042,Real Authentic Italian Tomato Sauce (No Can's Here),"Here’s the deal….if you want REAL authentic Italian tomato sauce, you’ve come to the right place. Sure you can save yourself all the time by opening a couple cans of diced/peeled tomatoes, but then again, that’s not authentic at all. You can freeze this sauce for later use.

This sauce is perfect for anything that requires a tomato sauce: e.g. spaghetti, lasagne, pizza sauce, etc. 

My girlfriend learned this authentic recipe while living in Italy for several years. It’s simple, but takes a lot of time and a lot of love, but its well worth the effort! This is for your free Saturday or Sunday when you will be in the house for the day. 

Add more tomatoes, garlic, or basil if you wish. There really is no set amount for each of these, but I do suggest a minimum of 10 whole red ripe tomatoes, and a minimum of 5 garlic cloves. Add some crushed red pepper to give it a kick if you wish. 

This recipe is the rundown of how I make the sauce now. It took me several attempts to really master this, but once you get it down you can make more tomatoes at a time. I usually work with two pots and start out with 10 in each pot, skin all the tomatoes in both, combine and start more in the empty pot to really make a large pot to freeze. The local vegetable stand sells 25 lb. baskets for $9 while in season. We do 50 lbs. a week for a month, so we can freeze and have great sauce all during the winter. 

I'm going to put this makes 4 servings, but I'm really not sure. The amount of sauce used per person differs.",https://www.food.com/recipe/real-authentic-italian-tomato-sauce-no-cans-here-325042,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/32/50/42/picF99tfs.jpg","red ripe whole tomatoes (beefsteak, use more for romas) | garlic cloves | fresh basil leaf | extra virgin olive oil | salt | (optional)","Wash, and core tomatoes. I also like to cut the little ""nub"" off of the bottom of the tomato. Just the nub, and this will make it easier to remove the skins from the tomatoes. | Place whole tomatoes in a large pot and drizzle 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over tomatoes. Place lid on pot and heat over medium. | After about 15 minutes give the tomatoes a stir (I use a fork to do this), ensuring not to break them up. This moves the ones on top to the bottom to help the skins to become loose and to prevent burning any skins. Cover and allow to cook for 15 more minutes. | After 15 minutes, take a fork and fish out a tomato from the bottom. Keeping the tomato in the pot, use two forks, or a fork and wood spoon to start removing the skins. If you like, you can take the tomato out and place on a plate or in a bowl to do this, just make sure you keep the juices. If the tomatoes are not fully ready to be skinned, put the lid back on and check every 5 minutes. (This is the most time consuming part, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes really simple.). | After all or most of the skins have been discarded, lower the temperature to medium low and allow to simmer uncovered. This is simply stewed tomatoes at this point. | Once an hour, check the sauce and stir thoroughly. Using a wooden spoon, start to break up the tomatoes over the period of checking them. (Note: Don’t break them all the way up on the first, second of even third time of checking them. Break them down over time). | After about 5 hours, smash all tomatoes with whatever instrument you can find that will work. Add garlic cloves whole, use more than 5 if you like, I DO! (Do not mince/chop garlic) Allow to simmer for another hour. (Note: If you feel the sauce has reached your desired consistency or is nearing, you can add the garlic earlier). | After 1 more hour, the garlic should be soft enough to smash easily on the side of the pot and the garlic will literally disintegrate into the sauce. If sauce is at your desired consistency, you can remove from the hot eye at this point and go to the next step, if you like your sauce a little less runny, or thicker, leave on and continue to monitor to your liking. | Once the sauce is to your desired consistency, remove from heat and add 1 cup of fresh basil leaves, stir. Fresh is important to making really good sauce. Salt to taste. If you like a little spice, add some crushed red pepper.",17,5,17,lactose | course | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | occasion | low-protein | sauces | main-dish | condiments-etc | pasta | easy | european | pizza | italian | lasagna | dietary | low-sodium | low-cholesterol | seasonal | low-saturated-fat | low-calorie | low-carb | inexpensive | egg-free | healthy-2 | free-of-something | low-in-something | pasta-rice-and-grains | spaghetti | ravioli-tortellini | presentation | served-hot

306861,Fancy Schmancy Citrus Granita,"A wildly refreshing dessert that will have your mouth singing! A unique and delicious granita and it's so easy to make!  This granita is a fancy schmancy way to end a meal, especially Italian. The citrus flavors refresh the palatte, while the basil gives the fresh taste of Italy
When our team thought of Italy, basil came right to mind. It just shouts Italy! We thought putting it in a frozen granita would be fancy, unique and delicious! 


Made up by the Fancy Feinschmeckers Team  for the Italian Frozen Dessert Challenge in the Zaar World Tour #4.

 Each team member picked an ingredient and told why they picked it: mliss29-I've always liked lemons, even since I was a little kid  -   Wildflower-I love orange anything! And the blossoms are so pretty, too! 
 Alskann- Some things you don't scrimp on; pure vanilla is one of the most complex flavors in the world, its unique flavor and aroma will blend beautifully with the fresh, tart citrus flavors and the herbal essence of the basil to make this granita both flavorful and aromatic  -   Celticevergreen-grapefruit juice-because it's my favorite flavor and to me is like tasting liquid sunshine  -   Nasseh-water-It is the foundation for so many things we love & enjoy. It is in almost every food, in some form or another  luvinlif2k-  I'm liking the slice of lime as an optional garnish. It should look lovely with the sprig of basil and if you like your granita a bit more tart, just squeeze some lime on your granita or rub your spoon with the lime before each bite  -     Heydarl-Basil Sprig, as I love basil & would like to be decorative   -  Sharon123-I picked salt! In Matthew 5:13 it says,""Ye are the salt of the earth"". Salt is also thrown over the shoulder for good luck. In ancient times, salt was precious and used to preserve meats, fish, etc. , and it also heightens the flavor of many foods.

344049,Fried Chorizo With Garlic,"Adapted from a recipe in 'The Australian Women's Weekly's TAPAS antipasto mezze'.  Chorizo sausage - surprisingly NOT in the Zaar Kitchen Dictionary - is a sausage of Spanish origin made from ground pork, garlic and chillies, so if you cannot get chorizo sausages that gives you the general idea: just substitute with a sausage you really like.  The appeal of the dish is certainly going to be largely determined by your choice of sausage; and if you like a bit of heat in your food, either choose a spicy sausage or add something like red pepper flakes in step three. 680g? Well, 500g = 1lb; 750g = 11/2lb, and exact quantities are obviously not crucial here. 5mm? 3mm =1/8 inch and 6mm = 1/4 inch.  Again, the exact size of the slices is not crucial, but be ready to decrease or increase your cooking time according to the thickness of your sausage slices.  You can prepare this recipe to the end of step two earlier in the day (and have the additional ingredients ready) and complete step three just prior to serving.",https://www.food.com/recipe/fried-chorizo-with-garlic-344049,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/34/40/49/picxtUYa3.jpg","chorizo sausages | olive oil | garlic cloves, finely minced | mixed dried Italian herb seasoning | red pepper flakes, to taste (optional) | fresh flat leaf parsley, finely chopped","Cut the sausages into 5mm slices; cook the sausage slices in a large heated pan, preferably non-stick, stirring until crisp; drain on absorbent paper. | Discard the fat from pan and wipe the pan clean with kitchen paper towelling. | Heat the olive oil in the same pan; cook the sausage slices, garlic, Italian herbs and red pepper flakes (if using) until they are heated through and serve the sausage slices on toothpicks, sprinkled with the fresh parsley, as part of an antipasto platter.",16,5,15,lactose | 15-minutes-or-less | time-to-make | course | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | occasion | south-west-pacific | very-low-carbs | appetizers | pork | australian | spanish | easy | european | beginner-cook | dinner-party | holiday-event | stove-top | dietary | christmas | gluten-free | high-protein | low-carb | inexpensive | egg-free | free-of-something | high-in-something | low-in-something | meat | pork-sausage | equipment | 3-steps-or-less

408043,Fortnum and Masons Authentic Scotch Eggs With Sausage and Herbs,"Freshly boiled eggs are encased in a herb flavoured sausage “jacket” and are then deep-fried until golden and crisp, delicious! Contrary to popular belief, Scotch eggs are not Scottish, and they were actually invented by the famous London department store “Fortnum & Mason” in 1738, where they are still available today. The word ""Scotch"" is an old English word meaning to chop or mince, and obviously, the eggs are covered with “chopped or minced” pork sausage meat, hence the name Scotch Eggs. They are traditional British picnic food but I also like to serve them as a light lunch or snack, and they make a wonderful addition to the buffet table. These tasty traditional English specialities have had bad press over the years; mainly down to commercial mass production, but if you make them at home with fresh, free-range eggs and the best quality sausage meat, they will taste divine, and they will always be the stars of the picnic hamper or family lunch table! PLEASE use high quality sausage meat or sausages, with at least 70% meat content.Historical Note: Founded in 1707, Fortnum & Mason (F&M) stocks ""food fit for a queen"". The 300-year-old  British department store, famous for its jams, teas, and sauces, provides the Queen with her annual supply of Christmas puddings and holds the ""Royal Warrant. NB: You can use quail's eggs with great results too - perfect for an elegant appetiser or starter.

307468,Jefes Grand Granita,"The sweet of all sweet..............to quench your thirst for complete ""heaven"" in a dish .......................fruits, juices, citrus, fresh mints.....could be that you will fall in love.

Towards the back of the local trattorie along the slight dirt pathway was a large flourishing mint patch that held many Italian dishes, beverages, and desserts hostage. The scent from that mint on this hot sultry night in Sicily, coupled by the ripe scent of blood oranges big as plums hanging with the branches of the tree above; perfumed the air as the warm breezes overtook our appetites, minds, and souls. 

Our wonderful group of friends that was made up ""Los Jefes"" was a bit tired from a long day of visit with neighboring towns and small villas. We decided to stop our travel at this amazingly quaint, beautiful local trattorie. Oh, how we rejoiced with this simple, but glorious Orange, Apple and Mint Granita. This was the special of the late afternoon, early evening, as the harvest had just completed and we were able to partake of this special treat at the end of the long, but glorious day. 

While there we tried to get Mama"" to part with the recipe. Unfortunately, no matter how much coaxing, promises, and smiles she wouldn't part with her family recipe. However; we had our memories, the taste still fresh in our minds, and we knew the fruits that were used. 

So ""Los Jefes"" put our heads together (and Chef floWer as the recipe writer) and (LittleKiwiChook as our taster) and came up with this honest replica of the sites, smells, and tastes of this Granita. 

Each one of us decided on which ingredient to add and why we loved it so. This brought so many memories it was an ease to do. 

With ripe, succulent blood oranges, crisp green apples, and married with fresh mint, we allowed this to frost all together thus producing a truly satisfying, most refreshing Granita. A treat that will bring all the joys of this special place and special time together to enjoy on some special evening ahead.

*NOTE: Based on some reviews, you may need to add a bit more water. Remember that there are lots of variables in baking, and that making any kind of yeast bread may require adjustment depending on climate, altitude, and your ingredients.

191479,"Crock Pot Normandy Pork With Apples, Shallots & Cider","A lovely slow cooked or crock pot recipe for tender chunks of pork cooked in cider with apples, shallots, creme fraiche & calvados. My own recipe devised for our Chambres d'Hotes here in France - and ALWAYS a firm favourite with guests, family & friends alike! It is my daughter's first night request when she comes home from university! You can use any cut of pork, but I usually use shoulder, neck, collar or blade of Pork - there are numerous names for that cut. It's sweeter and inclined to be more tender than Pork leg, which I feel is better roasted. You can also use Pork chops if you wish. If you have difficulty getting hold of cider or don't want to use alcohol, apple juice is just as good, for that appley zing! There is no duplicate for calvados, so just leave it out if you cannot obtain it, or use brandy or cognac instead. This makes a lovely pie filling if you have leftovers and as with most slow cooked recipes, it's very well behaved when re-heated! It goes extremely well with Recipe #191313 & mashed potatoes. N.B. I have given amounts for 8-10 people; the recipe can be halved or increased with ease!",https://www.food.com/recipe/crock-pot-normandy-pork-with-apples-shallots-cider-191479,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/19/14/79/picvO0OvW.jpg","pork shoulder, trimmed of fat & cubed | apples, cored & halved | shallots, peeled | balsamic vinegar | butter | olive oil | sweet apple cider | apple cider vinegar | creme fraiche or 6 ounces $template2$ | chicken stock, thickened | $template2$ | salt | black pepper | calvados or 1 -2 tablespoon $template2$","Trim the pork of any thick fat. Cut into large cubes of about 4"" square or even bigger - it shrinks with cooking & works better with larger pieces of meat. | Peel the shallots and set to one side. | Halve & core the apples and set to one side with the shallots. | Turn the crockpot onto High. Mix the cider, cider apple vinegar, creme fraiche, salt & pepper, thyme & thickened chicken stock together in a large pouring jug & pour into the crockpot.(If using fresh thyme - leave to last.) Add the cored and halved apples and replace the lid whilst you brown the pork & shallots. | Heat up half the butter & half of the olive oil in a large skillet or wok-type pan, one with fairly high sides. | As soon as it is smoking but not burning, brown the shallots in batches - you want a deep caramelised colour & the shallots just softened on the outside. When all the shallots have been done, put them all back into the pan - turn up the heat & add the balsamic vinegar and stir briskly making sure all the shallots are well coated. | Add the shallots & Balsamic vinegar mixture to the crockpot. | Heat up the remaining butter and oil, adding more if necessary & start to brown the pork pieces, again do not overcrowd the pan - they need to be well coloured & seared to seal in the juices. As the pork pieces are browned, add them to the crockpot. | When all the pork is browned & added to the crockpot, give all the ingredients a good mix around in the crockpot with a wooden spoon. If using fresh thyme, pick about 4 large sprigs and place on top of the Normandy Pork - the leaves fall off during cooking & leave the bare branches for throwing away! | Cook on high for between 6 - 10 hours. | Just before serving, pour in Calvados and mix through. Serve each person with 2 -3 pieces of pork, a cooked apple half & 1 or 2 shallots; add a dollop of creme fraiche on the side & garnish with Thyme & a fresh Apple sliver if desired. Decant the excess sauce into a gravy boat for extra saucy bits! | Great with spiced red cabbage, fluffy mashed potatoes or pommes Dauphinoise. | To cook in an conventional oven, follow recipe as above, but cook in a La Creuset type oven proof dish; pre-heat oven to 175 C or 350 F and cook slowly for about 6 hours, checking after 4 hours. It will cook quite happily for up to 8 hours if this helps in your time management, you may have to turn the oven down to about 125 C, 250 F after 4 hours for a long slow 8 hour cooking time.",15,"4,79",14,course | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | occasion | casseroles | main-dish | fruit | pork | french | oven | european | dinner-party | fall | kid-friendly | winter | stews | crock-pot-slow-cooker | dietary | seasonal | comfort-food | apples | meat | taste-mood | equipment

266688,Mixed Spice  - Traditional Old Fashioned English Pudding Spice,"The aromatic scent of holidays and Mum's home baking, mixed spice is an essential jar on the spice rack. Mixed spice is a blend of sweet spices traditionally used in English cooking to provide a warming backnote. This typically English spice mixture can be purchased ready-mixed, but I prefer to make my own, as I find it difficult to find in France and I have my own special blend. It is essential for fruit cakes, Christmas plum pudding, mincemeat and hot cross buns; mixed spice is also a great addition to other fruity desserts such as apple & fruit pies, crumbles and compotes. Try it in cream cheese desserts, pickles, chutneys and mulled wine too. Make it up and buy the spices needed in small quantities, as the mixture soon loses its full rich flavour. Allspice, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger are the usual blend of spices, but I sometimes like to add a few ground cardamom seeds as well as some ground coriander seeds.

115160,15 Layer Russian Honey Cake,"I recently tried a Russian Honey Cake, which was one of the yummiest cakes I have ever tasted. It was so nice I decided to find the recipe and learn to make it myself. It took me about 6 months searching the net (on websites mostly in Russian, which I definitely don't read or speak) translating from Russian using an online translator, and trying different recipes before I found this recipe, which has produced a result at least as nice as the one I tried.

I baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. Each batch took just long enough to cook, that I had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done.

The cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. The sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. The original recipe said to add sugar ""by intuition""; I think you're supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time I tried that it was too sickly sweet!

I have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). This was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream I used had gelatin in it. A slightly different taste, but a very nice variation.

I personally don't like walnuts all that much, so I leave them out whenever I cook this.",https://www.food.com/recipe/15-layer-russian-honey-cake-115160,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/11/51/60/picQvHmay.jpg","eggs | sugar | baking soda | liquid honey | margarine or 100 g $template2$ | flour | sour cream | sugar | honey | crushed plain sweet biscuit crumbs, for coating | ground walnuts, for coating","Preheat oven to 180°C. | Beat eggs well with sugar; add baking soda and liquid honey (warm). | Melt the margarine/butter in a casserole or pot; add the mixture (margarine should not be too hot). | Put the casserole on a low heat, add the flour while mixing and mix until the mass is without lumps (the mixture will be very thick and very hard to stir).

This recipe is very flexible, adapt the seasonings and add-ins to your family's preferences.

Zizz everything up until there are no more chunks of anything. Taste the mix and adjust - some garlic is mild some have more bite - you want a good strong garlic taste. The mix will be kind of soupy, it firms after chilling if you have leftovers - when you go to use it again let it soften a few minutes until spreadable. | If you add cheese you might not want to add the salt, especially if you use the kind in a can - I usually add fresh and like it with a little salt. Though the cheese can cause a little sticking on the grill, it tastes great and worth a little clean up.( If doing this in the broiler - don't add the cheese to the mix - but sprinkle it on the bread after you turn it over and broil till toasty. ). | Spread a nice thin coat of butter mix on both sides of you bread.

352555,Victoria Sandwich - Classic English Sponge Cake for Tea Time,"The Victoria Sandwich is the quintessential English cake, conjuring up images of old England and afternoon tea. It's always been a favourite in cake baking competitions and is even used by manufacturers to test new cookers.This is one of the recipes that I use when I make my Victoria Sandwich sponge cake - the other method is posted at the end of the recipe; the ingredients are the same but the weight ratio is slightly different. This method is the original and more traditional way of weighing your ingredients, bearing in mind that the recipe is Victorian! A true Victoria Sandwich would only contain jam, usually raspberry, but as the cake became more popular and cooks became more affluent, cream was added as a delicious addition. I was always taught that caster sugar was sprinkled on top - again, icing sugar is often used nowadays. This recipe adaptation was taken from the WI website, a wonderful organisation in Great Britain for woman of all ages, backgrounds, race or creed - remember The Calendar Girls? They were all WI members! Historical note: Anna, the Duchess of Bedford (1788-1861), one of Queen Victoria's ladies-in-waiting, is credited as the creator of tea time. She invited friends to join her for an additional afternoon meal at five o'clock in her rooms. The menu centred around small cakes, bread and butter sandwiches, assorted sweets, and, of course, tea.The practice of inviting friends to come for tea in the afternoon was quickly picked up by other social hostesses. Queen Victoria adopted the new craze for afternoon tea time. By 1855, the Queen and her ladies were in formal dress for the Victorian tea time parties. This simple cake was one of the queen's favourites and was named in honour of the Queen as a mark of the cake's most devoted followers!

Therefore, weigh the eggs first - if the eggs weigh 8 ounces, you will use 8 ounces of sugar, 8 ounces of butter or margarine and 8 ounces of flour. If the eggs weigh 6 ounces, all the other ingredients will be 6 ounces - easy! | Set oven Gas 4 160C (fan oven), 180C or 360F: grease and base line the bottom of 2 x 8” sandwich tins - cake tins. | Cream margarine or butter together with the sugar, until light and fluffy. | Beat the eggs, and then add them to the mixture, gradually and beating well after each addition. | Sieve the flour and fold into the mixture with a metal spoon. | Divide equally between the 2 prepared tins and bake for 25 minutes in the middle of the oven. | Remove and allow to cool for 1-2 minutes. | Remove from the tins and fill with raspberry jam (and cream if using) when cold, to avoid the cream melting or the jam seeping into the sponge. | A light dusting of caster sugar or icing sugar on the top will finish it. | Place on an attractive cake stand or plate, and serve in dainty wedges with freshly brewed tea. | Cook's Notes. | If you use butter remove from the fridge to soften before using. This is not necessary with soft margarine. | If large eggs are used they may weigh 7 ½ ozs/210g. If so make sure you use this weight for the other ingredients. | A smaller sandwich cake can be made with 2 medium eggs. Weight about 4 oz/55g.

298300,Perfect Bread Machine Spelt Bread,"My husband's quest to find a recipe which produces light, fluffy (rather than solid and dense) spelt bread from a bread machine has finally paid off.  He did lots of experimenting, and this one has produced consistently good results.

Update:  can't see how to respond to the review which found the bread heavy, so responding here.  If you definitely used WHITE spelt flour, not wholewheat, then it sounds as though perhaps different bread machines get different results? :-(  However, there is one other possibility.  Did you use fast action dried yeast, suitable for breadmakers?  Or Dried active yeast which is for hand baking?  We were using the former.  The other thing my husband suggested trying, if you're using the correct flour and yeast, is to try upping the amount of yeast you're using, and see if that helps.  You could also try upping the amount of water slightly, but try each solution separately first :-)  My husband's number one rule, stemming from his scientific background :-)  Hope one of these tips work, and not that it is the bread machine themselves (ours is a Panasonic SD255)",https://www.food.com/recipe/perfect-bread-machine-spelt-bread-298300,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/29/83/00/DZwFgSzQQGeMZVxHoLFq_2C4ACE87-B2CC-41D5-968E-3516B1305711.jpeg",white spelt flour | wholemeal spelt flour | fast-rising active dry yeast (6g) | tepid water | salt | sugar | vegetable oil,"Add water to bread machine, then oil, then flour, then salt, then sugar, then yeast. | Set on ""Normal"" setting (which is 4 hours), with small loaf and light crust settings. | NB: If you use wholegrain spelt rather than wholemeal, then reduce the yeast to 1.5 slightly rounded teaspoons (about 3.5g).",14,"4,75",13,course | cuisine | preparation | breads | easy | european | dietary | yeast | free-of-something | 3-steps-or-less

349170,The Queen of Hearts - Valentine's Jam Tarts,"Jam tarts are a quintessential British teatime treat - little crispy short crust pastry rounds filled with assorted fruit jams, such as strawberry, raspberry, apricot, blackcurrant and lemon curd. They were the first things my mum taught me to bake when I was little,  and in turn, I taught my daughter how to make them when she was very small. Here I have suggested that as a Valentine's Day treat, you top the jam tarts with a little pastry heart........after all, the way to a loved one's heart is through their stomach! Jam Tarts normally do NOT have any pastry topping however, so for the rest of the year, just make them as posted with no pastry lid, or use other suitable shapes appropriate for a special event. I have posted homemade short crust pastry, it is so easy to make and is far superior to ready-made, although I DO use ready-made when I am short of time! Try to use good quality or homemade jams and jellies, the higher the fruit content, the less the jam or jelly will bubble out of the pastry case.

The sauce is scrumptious, so make sure you provide plenty of fresh crusty bread for dipping. You can stir in cream if desired before placing in the oven.

106298,Konigsberger Klopse (German Meatballs in Creamy Caper Sauce),"A classic! Authentic Königsberger Klopse are made from ground veal, beef, and pork, along with a small amount of anchovies (or sardines or herring), chopped onions, bread crumbs, eggs, and spices. The traditional creamy sauce that accompanies the dumplings are made from the broth in which the dumplings were cooked, flour, cream, white wine, lemon juice, and capers. Delicious! Serve with boiled new potatoes and my Rotkohl recipe #108449 #108449. Also makes a great appetizer! A little history: Predecessors of the Königsberger Klopse date back to the Middle Ages. However, the East Prussian name Klops (Klops = meat dumpling)  didn't originate until the 18th century. Königsberger Klopse was invented in the city of Königsberg (then the capital of East Prussia; today known as Kaliningrad, Russia) around 200 years ago. My German/Polish/French grandmother was born and raised in East Prussia, about 30 kilometers from Königsberg. This recipe is my version of her delicious Königsberger Klopse, which she never wrote down but with the help of my mother I was finally able to replicate. I have many fond memories of enjoying this dish (which the women would prepare) at family gatherings, Sunday dinners, and special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. Still one of my top favorites!!! I hope your family enjoys, too. (Helpful Tips: These tender meatballs are braised NOT fried. If halving the meatball recipe, you will still need the full amount of stock for braising and for the gravy. The meatballs are somewhat delicate & time consuming to make; have someone help to form them into balls, it is much easier that way! For appetizers make them smaller and serve warm from the crock pot with toothpicks, buttered rolls and Potato Salad recipe #309891 #309891.

116269,Dutch Slavinken # 1,"Simple but very good comfort food.  Normally made with just some salt, pepper and nutmeg in the meat filling but I make them different these days and with many variations (just don't tell my mother!). Slavink translates as beatfinch (yes I know its weird) they are wrapped in bacon and another version is blinde vink= blind finch (even weirder) that is the same meat filling but then wrapped in a thin slice of veal. These days often replaced with a slice of beef. Some still name it blinde vink but the right name is runder vink=beef finch. I have tried very hard over the years to understand why they are named like this since I can honestly not see the resemblance of a bird in these sausages and I've never seen one fly away!
No Dutch person in their right mind makes them at home since you can buy them ready made from every butcher and in every super market. Now that information should tell you something about the poster of this recipe, who is Dutch....

208631,Nonna's Tiramisu,This is my grandmother's tiramisu.  I have been eating this for as long as I can remember and I have yet to try a tiramisu that I like better.    I made this over the weekend and I didn't have  kahlua on hand so I used creme de cacao instead and I think I may even prefer it that way now.  In the past I have omitted the liqueur and it has still been very good.  I have also used part-skim ricotta instead of mascarpone if I'm looking to lower calories and cost. Cook time is chill time for first the coffee and then for the cake itself.

I start with a pool of coffee about 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch deep. | One by one, roll the lady fingers in the coffee.

The restaurant is located in a very old and atmospheric building where the ""Old Hell Fire Club"" used to hold their meetings. The Witchery serves this delicious steak there, called Steak Balmoral, which has the most divine whisky sauce I have ever tasted! Serve this steak with chips (French fries), boiled, jacket or steamed new potatoes and seasonal greens or a tossed salad. The sauce is uniquely famous for its stunning simplicity - no need for onions or garlic, the cream, mustard, mushrooms and whisky tick all the taste boxes! More information from the restaurant's web-site: Located in an historic sixteenth-century building at the gates of Edinburgh Castle, James Thomson's Witchery is the most atmospheric and spectacular dining destination in the city.

A unique location,stunning interiors and superlative food, wine and service create memorable and magical dining experiences for locals, visitors and celebrities alike. Ewan MacGregor, Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones, Jack Nicholson and Clarissa Dickson Wright have all succumbed to its charms, with Andrew Lloyd Webber calling it the prettiest restaurant ever! 

Originally built for an Edinburgh merchant in 1595, this historic building on the Royal Mile now includes the jewel-like Witchery diningroom, the spectacular Secret Garden and a collection of totally indulgent and opulent suites on the floors above and in an adjacent historic building.

272691,The Best Braciole,"This is Giada DeLaurentis's recipe from her book Everyday Italian, and it is so wonderful.

And don't worry if some of the stuffing falls out during the browning - just spoon it back in if you can, or let it blend into the sauce.  It will be great.

A bit tricky to roll up, but the final product is worth all your hard work.You can substitute fresh red currants for the cranberries or use dried cranberries or dried cherries if you prefer.

332455,Quick and Creamy Boscaiola Pasta (Bacon and Mushroom),"I'm posting the original recipe, but will mention here, the changes I made, since I think that both are equally delicious.
I subbed tortellini (any kind, though I used beef) for the ....  well, actually, the recipe says, any pasta, though it recommends spaghetti.    Tortellini worked well!
And I subbed chorizo sausage for the bacon, since I had a lonely half a sausage in the freezer (about 100g).    I sliced it thinly.
I did use the mushrooms.    And I added garlic.
And I added fresh peas, lightly steamed, again, because I had them. I added them to the sauce in the last five minutes.

Very versatile recipe!!

135582,Zaarbucks Famous Apricot Almond Scones,"In July 2005, five women set out to Florence Italy to found Zaarbucks, a chain of kiosks serving coffees, teas, jaffles, fudge and baked goods.

388224,"Magic Fresh Tomato Spaghetti, Pasta or Pizza Sauce","Check out this trick - a whole, unpeeled tomato goes in the pot, and a tasty, seed-free, peel-free tomato sauce comes out!  Okay, well, maybe it's not really magic, but it's a great trick to save you from having to peel, chop, and de-seed all those tomatoes (which is the reason I almost never made sauce from my garden tomatoes until now).

We'll take care of the peels and seeds with a blender/food processor and a fine mesh strainer.  Yes, a couple of extra things to clean, but it's still faster than all that peeling and chopping!  Also, because the peels are cooked in the sauce, you preserve more of the nutrients in them.

This is a highly customizable recipe (really more a framework than anything else) - make it smooth or chunky, with meat or vegetarian, regular or low-sodium, or even use it to hide a few extra veggies (a tip for you parents of picky children - you can make them completely undetectable).  The quantities are inexact because there's so much variation in the size, taste and texture of fresh tomatoes, and anything else you add will change the flavor.  So you really have to adjust the seasonings and other ingredients to compensate.  This is part of the art of making tomato sauce, but don't be intimidated!  Just add a little bit at a time until it tastes right to you, remembering the axiom: ""You can always put more in, but you can't take it back out.""  Unless you have a real magic wand, of course. :)  NOTE: The quality of tomatoes will make or break this sauce; you MUST use fresh, vine-ripened tomatoes from your garden or a local farmer's market, not the variety you find in the grocery store that's been shipped in from another state.",https://www.food.com/recipe/magic-fresh-tomato-spaghetti-pasta-or-pizza-sauce-388224,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/38/82/24/4d2PzlCURJOZLM3bAP2l-Sos.jpg","olive oil | large onion, peeled and coarsely chopped | fresh garlic cloves, peeled and slightly crushed (may substitute jarred) | condensed beef broth (may substitute chicken or vegetable) | red wine (may substitute white, or extra broth) | whole fresh tomatoes (exact quantity varies based on size) | tomato paste (may need more depending on thickness desired) | herbs, to taste (I recommend basil and oregano, fresh or dried) | salt and pepper, to taste | meat (optional) | vegetables (optional)","Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chopped onions and garlic, and cook until onions are slightly soft and golden, stirring occasionally. | Pour in broth and wine, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. | Meanwhile, wash tomatoes. Cut off tops and any damaged parts. Add whole tomatoes to the pot as you go (reserve extra tomatoes to peel, dice and add later if you want a chunky sauce). Note: when I make this, I add however many tomatoes will fit in my 6-quart pot - you will adjust other ingredients later so the exact quantity doesn't matter. | You may add extra uncooked veggies you wish to ""hide"" in the sauce now. Some ideas - peas, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, even a little spinach. Be aware that it may slightly alter the color of the sauce - it can make it a little more orangey - but the tomatoes and seasonings will completely mask the flavor as long as you don't go overboard and add too much. | When all the tomatoes have been added and the broth is boiling, reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for about an hour, and then turn off heat. | Ladle sauce into a blender or food processor until about 2/3 full - you will need to work in batches. It will be soupy and very hot, so be careful.

Use a spoon to scrape the sides of the strainer if it clogs, and press all the liquid out. Discard the seeds and pulp from the peels that are left in the strainer.

Add any additional ingredients you want - diced tomatoes, browned beef or chicken, mushrooms, etc. | Return sauce to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for another 30-60 minutes.

386789,"Kielbasa, Homemade Kielbasa, Fresh Polish Sausage","Posting as requested.  We've perfected this recipe to OUR taste (very peppery and garlicky) over 20 years; my mother worked on it for years prior to that, even helping a Polish friend make it for a little Polish grocery store/butcher shop  she owned.  That said, we've found that it all works differently every year, depending on the quality of the meat, spices and casings.  There's always SOME kind of problem!  But it ends up remarkably consistent in taste.  The directions are deliberately lengthy, the way I wrote them for a non-Polish non-sausage-making friend.  And they're a little informal here and there. But DO read them through before you get into this project!    Prep time and sausage-making time are actually just a couple of hours each day for 2 days.  We use an electric grinder which forces the meat through a horn into the casing.
Recipe #387079 is our favorite way to cook this kielbasa.  Make this 3-4 weeks ahead, wrap very well, and freeze in vac packs.  You can also cook it before you freeze it; we don't.  We've kept this in the deep-freeze for several months with no loss in quality.  Oh, and we call this fresh sausage because we don't smoke it.  You certainly can do that, if you like the flavor.",https://www.food.com/recipe/kielbasa-homemade-kielbasa-fresh-polish-sausage-386789,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/38/67/89/U58qkiR663ebUXgIQdVM_7745_198356887032652_67569373_n.jpg","casing | pork butt, whole pieces, not ground, fatty is good | fresh garlic cloves | garlic powder (yes, powder, too!) | salt (we use kosher salt) | Accent seasoning | white sugar (some people use brown sugar, we don't) | fresh ground coarse black pepper | some people use a little marjoram, we don't","Put the garlic through a garlic press or mince really fine. Put the seasonings into a small pot with a pint of water. Boil and then cool. Here's where my Mom always said taste it and I wouldn't. That could account for the variance in taste from year to year! | Meanwhile, cut the pork off the bone. Cut into strips maybe 1"" by 3"". Doesn't have to be exact size, we get pretty sloppy with it. Strips go through the grinder better than chunks. Don't trim anything off, unless you just can't stand not to. Trust me, if there's not enough fat, the kielbasa will be dry and hard. DO trim off any bloody-type stuff though. We then put the meat into plastic dishpans, pour the cool liquid over, add about 4 cups ice cubes and mix together until your hands freeze. It should be kinda sloppy. If not, add more water or ice. Cover with aluminum foil or such and put in fridge over night to marinate so the meat soaks up the flavor. Stir occasionally. The ice will probably all be melted the next day before you make the sausage. The meat kind of absorbs the flavors. Yes, it will smell up the fridge. In fact, it will smell up the whole house! Open the windows. Make the neighbors crazy! | Next day, take the casings out and soak in warm water for several hours; it makes them more flexible. Cut in 4 ft. lengths. Shove the meat in the freezer for 1/2 to 1 hour before you start. The meat stiffens up a little and it's easier to put through the grinder. (We forget to do this a lot!) Stick one end of each casing on the faucet and run warm water through the inside of the casing. | Ready? (Keep everything as cold as you can) This is the fun part. Put a little oil on your hand and run it over the horn where the meat will come out. Run casing through fingers to drain slightly. Put a casing on the horn. One person helps push the meat through the grinder while the other holds the casing while it is filling up. It kinda curls up as you hold it. I find for me that it's better if I hold it up while it's filling, less pressure on the casing. We make each one about 12-16"". Or until it splits! Tie it off with string or knot the end if you can get it close to the end of the filled casing. Some people twist it every 6"" or so to make smaller sausages. If the darn thing splits, you gotta scrape out the meat, dump it back with the other stuff in the dishpan and start over. Some years you're lucky, but some years the darn things split all the time. That's one reason for soaking the casings for a longer time, they don't split as easily. Sometimes it's just a bad batch of casings. Then all you can do is swear at it. | We put the coils of sausage back into clean dishpans (on a rack if possible) and put back into fridge to kinda dry overnight. Then we pack them in Saran, aluminum foil, ziplock bags, anything that will keep the smell in, and put the packages in the freezer. We make 2-3 lb. packages. Since I have a vacuum sealer, I use that. It works really great. | By the way, the sausage is pale because it is not smoked. We don't care for smoked kielbasa. But you can smoke it before freezing. Can't help you with that, though! | We've been able to keep the sausage frozen for months. Just keep everything cold and clean while you're working. Keep a lot of paper towels handy to dry hands, answer the doggone telephone, etc. | We have found over the years, that pork has become much leaner now.That is sometimes a problem. We've considered buying more fat and mixing it in but never have. It worked out all right just not cutting off any fat. But insufficient fat makes for dry sausage. | It takes up about 1-1/2 hours altogether to fill the casings. It's really simple and easy. Of course sometimes we have splashes on the walls when ""someone"" gets a little rough pushing the meat through the grinder. Hey, that's the fun of it. It's a messy job, but someone has to do it. | Oh yeah, the house smells for 3-4 days. But it smells good. If you like garlic. All the seasonings are to your personal taste. You really need a lot of salt though. The pepper -- eh, how much do you like? We like a lot. Same with the garlic. | We keep a little of the ground meat and cook a couple of small patties of the sausage. That's when you can taste it and find out what you did wrong in the seasoning, too late, of course. | Use the plate in the grinder which grinds the meat coarse. It's better if the meat is a little chunky. You don't want a mealy texture. | If you run a search on google, you can find other information under kielbasa. | One recipe I found says to knead meat and seasonings. Supposedly the more you knead, the more tender the sausage. We've never tried that. | In recent years, we've set aside 3-4 lbs. of the ground sausage meat and made it into small patties like breakfast sausage, and larger patties like hamburgers. The grandkids really like that. We do, too.

Goes perfectly with a side of green beans; also wonderful with sugar snap peas, asparagus or spinach.

Crème fraîche thickens as it stands and the thicker it is, the thicker the finished sauce will be; many recipe call for leaving it out around 12 hours, or even up to 24, to set up. It is the bacterial cultures in the sour cream acting on the heavy cream that cause it to thicken and sour slightly, but from what I've read, it's a beneficial bacteria and perfectly safe to eat even when left out for that long (at any rate, I've left it out for that long and my family ate it and was perfectly fine).

Add the water mixture at once and mix with a wooden spoon. | If mixing becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, reach into the mixing bowl with very wet hands and press the mixture together. Note: kneading isn't necessary. | When everything is uniformly moist without dry patches your mixing is complete. This should take only a few minutes. The dough will be wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container. | Cover with a lid (not airtight) that fits well on the container. Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse, or at least flattens on the top, about 2 hours, depending on the room's temperature and the initial water temperature. Longer rising times, up to about 5 hours, will not harm the result. | You can use a portion of the dough anytime after this period. Fully refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature. So the first time you try this method, it's best to refrigerate the dough overnight, or at least 3 hours, before shaping a loaf. | The breads flavor improves with the retardation, so suggest you wait at least 24 hours before baking the first loaf! Dough may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 8 days. | BAKING (One 1-pouond loaf): With wet hands, pull up one end of the refrigerated dough. Using a serrated knife, cut off a 1-pound, or grapefruit-size, piece of dough. | Without using flour, shape into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go. Form into an oval-shaped loaf. | Place on a pizza peel dusted with cornmeal (or on parchment paper); allow to rest for 40 minutes - 1 1/2 hours, varies with temperature of the kitchen. (The shorter the time, the denser the crumb.). | Twenty minute before baking, place an empty cast-iron skillet or broiler tray on the bottom shelf and baking stone on center shelf; preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. | Using a pastry brush,, paint the top of the loaf with cornstarch wash, and sprinkle with caraway seeds. With a serrated bread knife, slash the top of the loaf with deep diagonal cuts. Slide the loaf directly onto the hot stone. Pour 1 cup of hot tap water into the broiler tray and quickly close the oven door. | Bake for about 35 - 40 minutes or until firm (interior temperature should be 198 - 200 degrees). Note: Larger or smaller loaves will require an adjustment to the baking time.

The porcini mushrooms really add a great flavor and deeper color to the beef broth. I'd be proud to serve this dish to company. Note: I recommend you prep all remaining ingredients while the dried porcini is steeping. The rest of the steps are very quick, and don't allow time for prepping as you go. Second note: I buy whole beef tenderloins at Costco for a very reasonable price. I remove the silver skin myself with a sharp meat carving knife.

Heat butter in large skillet and fry chicken pieces till browned. Remove from skillet and keep warm. Pour off most of fat from skillet and add chopped onions and garlic, saute till tender, add paprika and cook for a minute, add salt and pepper to onion mixture. Add chicken broth and stir well to remove mixture from bottom of pan. In a large dutch oven or cooking pot, add broth mixture and bring to a boil, add chicken. Make sure there is enough liquid to just cover all the chicken (if there is not enough, then add some water or more broth.)Cook covered on low heat till chicken is so tender it will fall off the bones.

188292,The Ospidillo Cafe Chicken Cacciatore,"Does your family love chicken like mine does? This is my clan's all-round favorite dish of any sort. The original recipe came from Mr. Food (Art Ginsberg) before I messed with it a bit to suit our tastes. It's easy, fairly cheap, feeds 6, sticks to your ribs, and can be prepared easily in 90 minutes. Once you have it going, you just monitor it and make your spaghetti to serve it over (you could serve it over rice). I make this chicken cacciatore at least once a month and they'd be happier around here if I made it once a week! It is much better if the skin is left on while cooking (chicken doesn't get leathery that way) -- you can pull it off (it practically falls off) when you serve it if you wish. Also, if you use plain table salt, cut it back to 1/2 a teaspoon. Sometimes I use whole chickens, cut up, (without the backs, necks, and organs, which I save for making stock), and sometimes just legs and thighs -- it really doesn't matter. We often take this recipe camping, making up the spaghetti ahead of time and storing it in zip-lock bags in the cooler. One final variation -- you can substitute an equivalent amount of fresh Roma tomatoes instead of the canned ones for a ""brighter"" flavor but, if you do, add 6 ounces of V-8 juice to the recipe.

286400,Canelés De Bordeaux -   French Rum and Vanilla Cakes,"Canelés de Bordeaux, also know as cannelé Bordelais, are magical French bakery confections, little fluted cakes with a rich rum and vanilla interior enclosed by a thin caramelised shell. This brilliant recipe was developed a long ago by an anonymous Bordeaux cook, whose innovation has been subjected to 300 years of refinements. Glossy and dark brown almost black at first sight, bittersweet at first bite, the crunchy burnt sugar canelé-shell makes an exquisite contrast to the smooth, sweet filling, fragrant with vanilla and rum.
These little cakes have recently gained cachet after years of neglect, to the extent that they may one day rival the popularity of crème brûlée in the category of caramelized French desserts. Baked in special tin-lined copper moulds, these delicious dessert cakes are often served with Cognac and Wine if you partake of a local degustation! The copper moulds are quite hard to find even in France - if you cannot find them, then these cakes can be made in individiual dariol moulds, small pudding basins, or the silcon moulds which are quite easy to find. This recipe makes 12 to 16 canelés, depending on the size of your moulds.

308197,Horiatiko Psomi: Crusty Country Bread,"In villages around Greece, this classic bread is still baked in outdoor wood-burning ovens. This bread is more dense than other types of bread (the loaf at right measures about 13 inches across and weighs a little more than 2 pounds) and can be made with a variety of flours or a combination of more than one. If you have your own sourdough starter, use 1/2 pound (slightly less than one cup for most starters) in place of the yeast in the recipe.

Ham and cheese has always been one of my favorites.

A little history:
In baking and pastry making, the term streusel (a German word meaning ""something scattered or sprinkled"", from the verb streuen, akin to the English verb 'strew') refers to a crumb topping of butter, flour, and white sugar (traditional German) that is baked on top of muffins, breads, and cakes (e.g. Streuselkuchen). Some modern recipes add various spices and occasionally chopped nutmeats. Although the topping is of German origin, it is sometimes referred to as Danish or Swedish.",https://www.food.com/recipe/so-easy-and-tasty-apple-streusel-405704,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/40/57/04/pic4Vy78v.jpg",large fall apples (Cortland or McIntosh are both great) | sugar | cinnamon | pure vanilla extract | cold butter 4 tbls. or 1/4 cup | flour | sugar | cinnamon | ground nutmeg optional,"Preheat oven to 350°. | Grease the bottom only of a small (4 cups or so) casserole dish. Peel and core the apples, slice and place in a bowl. Top with sugar, cinnamon and vanilla, toss to coat. Set aside while preparing topping. | Make the streusel by cutting the cold butter into a bowl, adding flour, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg, if using. Rub it through your fingers until the streusel is a coarse, sandy/pebbly texture. | Put the seasoned apples into the pan, top generously with the streusel, and bake at 350° about 30 minutes, or until the streusel is golden brown and the apple is starting to bubble up through the topping. | Serve and enjoy!",11,"4,9",10,weeknight | 60-minutes-or-less | time-to-make | course | main-ingredient | cuisine | preparation | occasion | low-protein | healthy | breakfast | desserts | fruit | german | scandinavian | european | dinner-party | holiday-event | vegetarian | dietary | low-sodium | low-in-something | apples

Although the term ""Ploughman’s Lunch"" was first coined in the 1930’s, as part of a very successful marketing campaign, the concept behind it goes back much further. Throughout the centuries, agricultural workers would take their lunch out to the fields with them; this usually consisted of bread and cheese with ale or cider - a perfect combination! It's easy to prepare and should consist of at least the following: crusty bread and butter; a selection of English cheeses; pickled onions; chutney and pickles.

421076,Old Fashioned Home-Made English Crumpets for Tea-Time,"MUCH better than shop bought crumpets, these are easy to make and are a rewarding and comforting meal for breakfast, tea or supper. Crumpets, pikelets, Scotch pancakes and English muffins: all traditional British tea-time treats but what's the difference? That's a good question! They're all cooked on a griddle or bakestone (a heavy-based frying-pan can be used as an alternative) but crumpets and muffins are both yeast-based. To make crumpets, you need egg rings (available from kitchen or hardware shops) or, if you can get them, special crumpet rings, and they need to be well-greased. More about crumpets: crumpets are flattened round breads which are cooked on a griddle or in a skillet. They are closely associated with English society and culture, and are sometimes confused with English muffins. Although the crumpet and the English muffin share some characteristics, the two foods are in fact very different. Classic crumpets have a smooth round bottom, and a top riddled with small holes. They are served fresh from the griddle or toasted, and can be topped with cheese, bacon, honey, jam or clotted cream - although butter is the traditional crumpet topping. Crumpets are never split, unlike English muffins, and they have a slightly spongy texture which absorbs butter remarkably well. The concept of toasting crumpets over a fire is often associated with companionable rainy days in British fiction. For people who are still confused about the differences between crumpets and English muffins, remember that crumpets have a holey top, they are not split, and they are far less ""bready"" than English muffins tend to be. It is believed that the English muffin may have been invented by someone who was trying to replicate the crumpet, which explains the commonalities between the two. The recipes for English muffins and crumpets are also very different, with crumpets being made from batter and English muffins being made from a dough. Because crumpets are made from a batter, they must be cooked in metal rings called crumpet rings or they will lose their shape.",https://www.food.com/recipe/old-fashioned-home-made-english-crumpets-for-tea-time-421076,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/42/10/76/picsekBzj.jpg","strong plain flour, sifted (1lb) | salt | sugar | fast-rising active dry yeast (1x7g sachet) | warm milk (1/2 pint) | warm water (1/2 pint) | bicarbonate of soda | vegetable oil","Note - you will need 4 crumpet rings, or egg rings or 7.5cm (3in) plain pastry cutters, greased. | Place the flour and salt into a large bowl and stir in the sugar and yeast making a well in the centre. Pour in the warm milk and water and mix to give quite a thick batter. Beat well until completely combined and cover with a tea towel or cling film. | Leave in a warm place to rise for about an hour until it's a light, spongy texture. Stir well to knock out any air, add the bicarbonate of soda and pour into a large jug - mix well and allow to stand for a further 30 minutes. | Heat a non-stick frying pan, or a greased griddle, over a very low heat with a drop of oil or butter. Wipe the pan with kitchen paper to remove excess oil/butter. Sit the greased crumpet rings in the pan and leave to heat up for a couple of minutes. | Pour in enough mixture to fill the rings just over halfway up the sides. Leave to cook until lots of small holes appear on the surface and the batter has just dried out. This will take about 8-10 minutes. | Remove the rings and turn over the crumpets to cook for a further minute or two on the other side. Sit the first batch of crumpets on a wire rack whilst continuing to cook the remaining crumpets. | Serve the crumpets warm, generously buttered.

100104,Pesche - Italian Peach Wedding Cookies,"Years ago, my grandmother and great-aunt went to Italy for their cousin's daughter's wedding. They ALWAYS tell the story of this glorious table full of these delectable cookies shaped like little peaches. My great-aunt, being the baker of the family, asked her cousin for the recipe. She was told that these lovely little cookies were traditionally served at weddings there in their small Italian village. The recipe itself is quite simple, however, it is the method in which you assemble the cookies that makes these so unique. My great aunt adapted the original filling. In Italy, the peach cookies were filled with cream custard held together at the crease by dark chocolate. Because she needed to make her's in advance, she changes the filling to peach preserves. If you use the traditional cream for the filling, the cookies must be made and eaten THAT DAY. I've left the recipe in her original words. The number of cookies this makes is an ESTIMATE!

204044,Mama Leone's Italian Tomato Sauce (Good for Many Uses),"I grew up across the street from a real Mama Leone—an amazing Irish woman who had an Italian husband and a live-in Italian mother-in-law who taught her to cook. This awesome recipe was a neighbourhood favourite. It has been equally popular with everyone who has ever tasted it. It is an all-purpose Italian sauce. I usually make it for spaghetti and have added optional instructions for that purpose. Without the meat, it is vegan friendly. It's also a good pizza sauce base.

187956,Hawaiian Coconut Shortbread Cookies,"This is a recipe from an old Sunset Desserts Cookbook, likely from the 1970's, that was lost during a move. I searched high and low on the internet for this exact recipe, as I remembered it, to no avail. I finally found a copy of the recipe I had handwritten and placed in my mother's very old cookbook many years ago. Eureka! I wanted to post it here, so that I wouldn't lose it, and to share so others could enjoy them as well. I used to make these occasionally as a special treat for our family and for holidays and events. Rich and buttery with that wonderful coconut taste with a powdered sugar coating similar to wedding cookies. These are pretty simple to make and are ""jr. chef assistant"" friendly, especially for little hands to coat them in powdered sugar. Probably one of the best things about these cookies is that they are so great for a ""make-ahead"" cookie, as the dough is refrigerated and sliced, so you can break up the prep time into different days. Also, the baked cookies improve in flavor as they mature, so another ""do-ahead"" advantage. They are ideal for ""care packages"" to mail, if cushioned and packed securely, as they don't go stale. I hope you enjoy these as much as our family and guests have :)",https://www.food.com/recipe/hawaiian-coconut-shortbread-cookies-187956,"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/f_auto,c_thumb,q_55,w_744,ar_5:4/v1/img/recipes/18/79/56/pichpYOb3.jpg","butter, softened (8 ounces) | granulated sugar | vanilla | all-purpose flour (measured after sifting) | salt | sweetened flaked coconut | powdered sugar, Sifted (or more as needed, for coating after baking)","Cream the butter until smooth.

Add salt to flour and sift again. | Gradually add to the creamed butter mixture until you have added all the flour and mixture is smooth. Mix the coconut into the cookie dough. | Shape into a one and half (1.5) inch diameter roll and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until it the dough is firm, about 2-4 hours, or for several days until ready to use. May be frozen for later baking. | Using a sharp knife, cut 1/4 inch slices from the cookie dough roll and place on a very lightly greased cookie sheet, about 1 inch apart. | Bake at 300 degrees for about 20 minutes, until a light golden brown at edges, but not browned entirely across the top. | Cool cookies on sheet just until they are set, easy to remove and have cooled slightly, usually about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove cookies with a spatula and place on the 1 cup of powdered sugar that you have sifted onto a piece of wax paper or similar surface. Cover cookies with powdered sugar on all sides by sifting more sugar over them or ""rolling"" them in the sugar. After they have cooled and the powdered sugar has ""set"", you can coat them with more powdered sugar if you would like. Cool completely and then store in an airtight container, for however long you can keep them from being eaten! | Try these the first time following the recipe as given. The next time, you can play around with adding other ingredients to tweak these to your exact tastes. Some ideas, toasting some of the coconut before adding to the dough, adding finely chopped macadamia nuts, ginger, cardamom or any citrus zest.
