This was because my father is originally from Sardinia, and my parents always believed that our childhood and upbringing would be better in a small Sardinian village than in a big city like Genoa.
I learned to cook out of pure desire (not that I'm a great chef), but my mother and father have always cooked, and for this reason, and because of every child's curiosity about the world of adults, I tried my hand at cooking at a very young age. For example, when I was 12 or 13, my parents knew that if they were away for half a day, I would be able to cook lunch for myself and my younger brother. I still remember that the first dish I cooked was a simple pasta dish with sauce, helped by my mother, of course, and for this reason it's still one of my favorite dishes. Furthermore, my grandmother (like all grandmothers) always cooked a lot, and let's just say that food has always been a part of my life. Even today, when I go out with friends or my girlfriend, my favorite and most satisfying moment is definitely when we sit down to eat, whether at home or at a pizzeria or restaurant. When it comes to food traditions, my parents have always been strict, in the good sense of the word. In fact, at home we have a wide-ranging diet that includes practically every type of food, and we rarely consume overly processed or overly industrial foods. 
I've had the opportunity to travel quite a bit in recent years, especially in Europe, and especially in Portugal and Spain. The cuisines I've tasted aren't that different from our own in terms of ingredients, but I was pleasantly surprised by some typical dishes, like paella and Francesinha. For now, I feel I must mention two other cuisines that I particularly love: Asian and Indian, which I appreciate for their flavours and especially for the spices used. I also feel compelled to mention some of my all-time favorite dishes, including lasagna, pizza, pasta with turnip tops, and pumpkin and sausage risotto. I don't have any allergies, and the sport I practice doesn't require any specific diet, so these are my dietary preferences, and I hope I've explained them clearly enough.",2284,407

But as time went by, I began to get used to it and experiment with simple recipes. I also discovered that I enjoy cooking, but above all, eating delicious yet healthy foods. Since living away from my family, I've learned to eat properly, with the right macronutrients my body needs. My favorite foods are pizza and seafood fregola.

I've also tried other cuisines, like Malaysian and Indian, but I didn't particularly like Indian cuisine; it's too spicy for my taste. My cooking style now revolves around preparing quick meals that can be eaten cold the next day for lunch at university during the week. On weekends, when I have more free time and eat lunch at home, I have more time and the opportunity to create more sophisticated dishes. I'd like to take up a sport, because I spend all day sitting at the computer, but right now I can't fit it into my routine due to my busy schedule.

My preference between sweet and savory falls on the latter because after going through a period of gym and serious diet that led me to almost never eat sweets, sweet food tends to make me nauseous very quickly and to be honest I don't even feel the need to eat particularly sweet foods. The gym, although not in an exaggerated way, has shaped my current view of food, because it helped me discover healthy but also tasty foods, it helped me discard others that were too harmful, so unconsciously and automatically if I have the possibility and, above all, the desire, I tend to prefer the healthier foods discovered with that lifestyle. As banal as it may be, my favorite cuisine is Italian because it manages to find the right balance between taste, variety, heaviness on the stomach, and healthiness. While among the various cuisines I've tried, Spanish, Hungarian, French, German, and Chinese, my favorite is the last one, which is the only one that made me try totally new and particularly strong flavors but without being stomach-churning and difficult to digest.

Over time, this led me to prefer simple, practical dishes based on pasta, rice, and legumes. I tend not to prepare elaborate meat dishes, and I almost never cook fish myself, although fish has always been a regular part of my diet when I eat at my parents’ home.

Travel has contributed to broadening my understanding of different cuisines. I always try local dishes when visiting new places, even though I rarely attempt to replicate them once I return home. They usually remain linked to the context of the trip rather than becoming part of my everyday cooking routine.

After the age of twenty-five, my lifestyle became more sedentary, and moving out of my parents’ home introduced further changes. The transition brought more flexibility but also less consistency, occasionally leading to less structured eating habits. Despite this, I cook on a daily basis and generally follow a Mediterranean pattern, alternating pasta, rice, and legumes, and incorporating meat or occasionally fish (mainly when I eat with my parents) several times a week.

I enjoy watching cooking programs like MasterChef and various food vlogs, but these rarely influence what I choose to cook.

I have lived mainly in Italy, but in the past I spent about a year in London, England. My family has Piedmontese origins, but also southern Italian origins on my great-grandmother's side.

I learned to cook by watching my mother when I was little, as she is an excellent cook who learned both from her life in Piedmont and from her grandmother, who came from southern Italy. 
For me, traditional food is Piedmontese food, as I have been eating it since I was a child. This cuisine uses many ingredients (from vegetables to meat) and generally has strong flavors (one of the typical dishes has only anchovies, garlic, and oil as ingredients). Other typical dishes are polenta with stew, meat (both raw and cooked in different ways, such as boiled), and fresh stuffed pasta such as agnolotti.
At home with my parents, I always ate classic Italian dishes (including lots of vegetables and meat) or traditional Piedmontese dishes, but my mother often cooked typical dishes from southern Italy or made fresh pasta. 

Despite my Italian origins, I have tried many different cuisines: one of my favorites is Moroccan. During my time in London, I hated English food, so I continued to eat and prepare Italian dishes.
Since I've been living alone, I've started eating less meat and more vegetables, mainly because of the ever-increasing cost of meat. 
Now I generally eat and cook classic Italian dishes. My diet is fairly standard: lots of pasta, all kinds of vegetables, cheese, and meat (both chicken and beef). 
Given my origins, I continue to appreciate very strong flavors, such as very mature cheeses.
I often cook classic dishes that are quick to prepare, including salads with lettuce, tomatoes, and any vegetables, pasta with sauce or pesto, or even meals such as piadina with cold cuts (such as prosciutto).

I don't eat desserts, as I don't particularly like them, but I love coffee.

Growing up in Italy, I learned early on that food is far more than nourishment—it’s a language of care, tradition, and creativity. My earliest memories involve long family meals where recipes were passed down through conversation rather than written instructions. Those moments taught me to value the sensory aspects of cooking—the smell of fresh herbs, the texture of handmade pasta, the slow transformation of ingredients into something comforting and communal.

Over the years, my relationship with food has evolved from following tradition to exploring it. I enjoy experimenting with both regional dishes and new flavors, often combining elements of Friulian cuisine with influences from my travels and research stays abroad. Cooking has become a meditative process and a way of balancing my analytical work in technology with something tactile and expressive.

Food also connects strongly to my interest in sustainability and mindful living. I try to cook seasonally, minimize waste, and understand where my ingredients come from.

A journey to Poland made me realize that I dislike garlic, which was used excessively in the local cuisine.

When I started university and moved away from my family, I made a drastic shift toward a healthier diet, reducing meat consumption and significantly increasing my intake of vegetables. I developed an interest in Japanese animation and, through it, became closer to Asian culinary culture, particularly ramen and sushi. University social life led me to share common group foods such as kebab and sushi. During this period, I began eating more dishes containing onions and spices and stopped using salt. I also made an effort to appreciate local dishes I had disliked as a child, such as asparagus-based meals.

More recently, I have started to approach the world of desserts, as I often go out for breakfast with friends.",1427,242

I have only travelled locally so I have not discovered any unusual cuisines, just the standard Asian & African stuff. My favorite restaurant since I was young has been a franchise called Mike's Kitchen. It is more of a steak ranch.

I have recently been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes so I have decide to change my diet completely and focus on whole foods, veggies and all things that are beneficial to my health.

My preference is Asian food, as it taste the most fresh and emphasizes the taste of the ingredients. From all Asian food my preference is Indonesian, if they make food spicy it not only has thousands levels but they find in every dish a different way to make it spicy, the layers of taste are without number. The food from my own country is very bland so for me it is an adventure every time I go abroad and discover new ways to enjoy food. On top of that it is an integral part of how different people live together, knowing their food and how they eat gives insight in who they are as a people.

I mostly eat an 80-20 diet, where the 80 refers to anything healthy for the body, and the 20 refers to 'anything goes'. The reason I do this is to enable long-term good health, and also because I had a recent health scare which prompted me to prioritise my well-being. I would say my favourite cuisine is Malaysian due to my heritage and because of the vast variety of dishes available. I usually cook every day but I have to admit being a lousy cook; my mum often does a lot of the cooking too. I have some restrictions such as gluten, egg white, and yeast intolerance, as well as an egg-white allergy.

This didn't always be the case. Growing up I used to be fussy with foods, particularly with egetables such as onions, cabbage, etc. I didn't like the taste or texture. I used to separate thes ingredients out of sauces and meals. As I have gotten older I now enjoy putting these ingerdients into meals. 

I do have a severe allergy to nuts and so I must aviod all foods that contain a nut. This allergy is to all nuts. This makes it difficult to try new foods, particularly in countries with a strong language barrier. This does restrict how adventerous I can be with new meals and often it is not worth the hassle and is better for me to stick to foods I know are safe and tasty.

I have a new resolution this year which is to try a new meal eevry month. This is to try and add some new dishes to my list and help add more variety to my diet.",896,175

I had food technology lessons in school, which taught me the basic of cooking, but I haven't had any proper training or lessons from anyone other than this, I taught myself through experimentation.

For most of my life my diet has been incredibly unhealthy and I have been obese all my life.  I had a very negative relationship with food and would binge eat on a regular basis.  18 months ago I had a gastric sleeve operation which significantly changed the way I eat.  Initially I could only eat tiny portions of anything, but now I can eat a lot more, but my diet is focused mainly on lean protein and vegetables.  It is now a lot healthier, although I rarely cook and mainly rely on ready meals supplemented with extra veg.  I have lost 11 stone in weight and would now consider myself to be fit and healthy so I am interested in making food choices that continue this theme.  I still think my relationship with food is unhealthy, I still have the occasional binge but I am much more controlled now and don't want to undo all my progress.

It is difficult to cook for the whole family because we all eat so differently - my daughter is very picky and relies more on frozen, oven-cooked food like fish fingers and chicken nuggets, whereas my husband and son are much more adventurous.  I can only eat smaller portions, so if I cook it is usually for my husband and son and I will either have a little bit of their food or cook something separate for me.

6773d589c3198df1ab5f8887,"Food to me is a source of comfort, connection, and a journey of mindful eating that has evolved significantly over my lifetime. It's an integral part of my identity and well-being.
I was born in a small town where family meals were a daily ritual. My fondest memories are of learning to cook traditional dishes like pasta and stews from my mum. This early exposure instilled a deep appreciation for homemade meals and fresh ingredients. My culinary passion was sparked by these moments of shared joy and warmth around the dinner table.

Travel has broadened these culinary horizons immensely. A trip to Morocco,, in particular, opened my eyes to complex spices and vibrant street food. This experience pushed me to experiment with new flavours and ingredients. Trips to Italy and other parts of Europe made me better appreciate standard dishes when they are made at their best.


My current cooking style is focused on nutrition and flavour. I love experimenting with new recipes. I cook almost daily. I practice mindful eating, listening to my body's hunger and fullness cues to make intentional choices. I have no specific allergies, but I choose to limit processed sugars and unhealthy fats to maintain my health goals.


Dishes like my mums family meals always bring me back to my roots and the feeling of home. It's a reminder of the power of simple ingredients and cherished memories.

5daec9633990ed0014564662,"I’m from Spain, where food has always been an important part of daily life and family time. Growing up, meals were moments to slow down, sit together, and enjoy simple but meaningful dishes. Although I didn’t start cooking seriously at a very young age, being surrounded by traditional Spanish food helped shape my appreciation for fresh ingredients, home-cooked meals, and balanced flavors.

My relationship with food changed significantly about seven years ago, when I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, and fructose malabsorption. Since then, eating has become both a challenge and a learning process. I’ve had to pay close attention to how different foods affect my digestion, which pushed me to understand ingredients better and be more intentional with what I eat. Foods like garlic, onion, or dairy can be tricky for me, so adapting recipes and finding alternatives has become part of my routine.

I enjoy cooking simple, practical meals that make me feel good physically, without giving up flavor. I tend to cook at home regularly, focusing on easy dishes with ingredients I tolerate well. I don’t follow one specific cuisine, but I’m especially drawn to Mediterranean-style meals, rice dishes, eggs, vegetables, and straightforward proteins. I prefer food that’s comforting, not overly processed, and easy to digest.

Travel and eating out have taught me to be flexible and curious, even with restrictions. Some of my most memorable food experiences come from discovering dishes that are both delicious and gentle on my stomach. Overall, food for me is about balance: enjoying what I eat while taking care of my health and listening to my body.

I choose this meal because I was a lot into fitness, and decided that once I lived on my own I would like to cook healthy meals that would contribute to my fitness journey. I still cook like this today.

I always cook meals with high levels of protein, and I also try to reduce the amount of processed foods that I consume. I do not like sweet snacks, and rather have a nice piece of meat or fish whenever I feel like snacking.

During my trips to China and the Caribbean I learned a lot about new types of foods. I love to travel and try new things, except for that time I went to India and got food poisoning (also the reason why I do not like Indian food, understandably).

I also like to try and visit new restaurants, sometimes small, local restaurants or street vendors, other time high-end Michelin star restaurants.

I enjoy roast dinners, pasta dishes, chilli, steak pie, shepherds pie etc and I try to eat vegetables with most meals or have salad with them. I try to avoid too many pre-packaged foods and cereals. Breakfast tends to be sourdough toast, avocado and eggs as this is reasonably healthy and it fills me up. Occasionally, I will make homemade pancakes to have with fruit and yogurt. I have natural yogurt with banana and berries quite often and sometimes include a low-sugar, high-protein granola which has a lot of nuts and seeds. For lunch, I try to incorporate lean protein, with chicken, tuna, egg being my preferences and always with salad. I do have a sweet tooth and although I try to be mindful of eating too much sugar, I could cut out puddings which I have a few times per week. I do try to bake my own when I have them, so I know they're not full of additives and preservatives as well. I think most people, like me, are time poor these days and having to shop for food, plan recipes and then find time to cook, can be difficult. I am also trying to eat well whilst reducing my overall outgoings as money has become tighter, so that is another difficulty and something I have to be mindful of.",1695,315

I'm 5,97 feet tall and I weight 198lb, so currently I'm overweight. These days I'm feeling a lot of pressure in my current job, so my way to deal with stress is eating.
There are not so many things that I don't like to eat. I struggle a bit more with vegetables but I'm disciplined enough to eat enough every week. My favourite food is pizza.

6229dc51dff340226697778e,Hello. I'm 61 one years old and married with two children aged eight and thirteen. We live in Nottinghamshire in the United Kingdom. I used to work as a software developer but am now retired. From a food perspective I've never really had a sweet tooth and always preferred savory items as opposed to sweet things so if snacking usually take a bag of crisps over a biscuit. I try to maintain a balanced diet but don't really eat the recommended amount of fruit and veg. I don't really like fruit to be fair. I probably eat too many chips but as I get older I tend to prefer things like curry's as I really enjoy spicy food. I don't tend to eat puddings. I do enjoy a glass of wine and brew my own to save money. I usually have a boiled egg and brown toast for breakfast. Lunch and dinners vary. ,794,154

I didn't learn to cook and I can only cook the basic things. My most memorable meal was fried shrimps and I really like fish-soup/fish juice (a Hungarian traditional soup). I have loved the Italian cousine when I was in Rome and Florence. I had to switch to more protein-rich eating habit and a more vitamin-D-rich eating habit because of my vitamin-D deficiency that they descovered in my body (system). My favourite cousine is the Hungarian one. My typical meals are roasted chicken with rice and cauliflower soup. Or at least this is the one which I consume the most of. I do not cook at all. I do not have dietary restrictions at the moment and I do not have allergies. Nor serious health related food considerations. I do not have such hobbies which would influence my food choices really. I very much liked a Greek restaurant in Korfu which was in fact the one where I ate those fried shrimps.,1015,185

I was born in the United Kingdom. I liked tomato sauces when I was younger, and so had a load of baked beans, ratatouille, tomato soup, and tomato-based curries. My Dad liked cooking, so I wasn't sheltered from foods from other cultures, but I tended to keep things simple. I recall eating Chinese, Indian and Japanese cuisune when I was younger. I haven't travelled, so as a result, I have not developed much of a taste from travelling. I developed anorexia as a teenager, which made my already fairly picky tastes even more restrictive, and since then, I have been Vegan. My taste in tomato-based foods hasn't changed, but due to my current gallbladder disease, until I am able to get it treated, I have had to be careful in what I eat, and as such, tend to stick to very simple foods, such as banana smoothies and plain pasta meals. My style in cooking is to keep things simple, because I frankly don't want to spend more time on food than I have to. I consider it a low priority in life. As long as I am getting the nutrients I need and it is easy enough to eat, then I am content.",1125,205

It is a very very rural area. During this time I got to leave the city and do chores on my Grandmothers ""mini"" farm. Everyone there has a robust garden of at least an acre of land as they have a very short growing window and what you planted you ate in the winter and canned. I can remember my Grandmother being very patient with me and my sister and we would pull the vegetables, was them, and help can them for winter use. My Grandmother was a truly exceptional cook and taught me many of the basics for sauces, doughs, jams, canning and other pairing of food that I still use to this day.

My Mum worked but looking back always managed to cook from scratch.  I disliked meat as far back as I can remember, but was always encouraged to eat it, even though I would complain.  This gave me a severe dislike of meat and as soon as I left home I became a vegetarian. Its something that has lasted a lifetime.  I have signed up for a medical trial on which I take a 14mg tablet of semaglutide.  This does somewhat control my hunger, but doesn't turn off the food noise which makes me indulge in snacks.  My husband does the cooking and has done for 40 odd years.  So I don't have the excuse that I am surrounded by food and forced to cook.

At the moment, I mostly cook for practicality rather than preference, as I do not have much time and cooking has become just another 'daily task'. 

Regarding dietary restrictions, I am lactose intolerant, although it doesn't significantly affect my diet.

My mother was a wonderful cook and both myself and my brother and sister very early on began to equate food with love. My mother struggled financially a lot, but one of the ways that she 'gave' us things was to cook wonderful home-cooked meals for us. She also packed us amazing lunches that were the envy of our classmates. I mention this childhood experience because it very much has translated to me using food as love an adult. One of the ways that I know I show others that I care about them is to bring them food items, such as snacks, treats or meals. I am aware that I do this and know that sometimes it is not a good idea. For example, I have a nephew who is very overweight and I should not shower him with treats the way that I do. But in some ways, I feel that I can't help it. I love making things for people and bringing them food gifts as a way that I show that I care, and I feel my mother's legacy (she passed away in 2008) when I do this.
